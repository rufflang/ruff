# Ruff Field Notes — Hashmap loop fusion, JIT sealing fix, and v0.9.0 release prep

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Session:** 14:52 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 7f37e2b
**Scope:** Implemented hashmap-oriented bytecode/compiler/VM optimizations, fixed JIT sealing regressions causing test failures, and completed release preparation for v0.9.0. Validated with full build/test and cross-language benchmarks.

---

## What I Changed
- Added fused hashmap loop opcodes in `src/bytecode.rs` for common integer map accumulation/fill patterns.
- Added compiler pattern lowering for canonical while-loop hashmap patterns in `src/compiler.rs`.
- Implemented fused opcode execution paths and VM-level tests in `src/vm.rs`.
- Fixed Cranelift block sealing regressions in `src/jit.rs` to eliminate panics in JIT tests.
- Updated release/docs metadata in `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, and `Cargo.toml` for v0.9.0.
- Ran `cargo build`, `cargo test`, and full cross-language benchmarks via `benchmarks/cross-language/run_benchmarks.sh`.
- Created release commit and tag, then pushed `main` and `v0.9.0` to remote.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Cranelift block sealing must happen in strict control-flow order.
  - **Symptom:** JIT tests panic with Cranelift assertions around already-sealed or improperly sealed blocks.
  - **Root cause:** Some paths sealed blocks early or attempted duplicate sealing when loop/header flow had multiple edges.
  - **Fix:** Centralized and corrected sealing logic in `src/jit.rs` so blocks are sealed exactly once at the right stage.
  - **Prevention:** Treat block sealing as a control-flow invariant; when touching JIT branching/loops, re-run targeted JIT tests before full suite.

- **Gotcha:** Hashmap loop fusion only applies to specific canonical shapes.
  - **Symptom:** Expected fusion does not occur for semantically equivalent loops with reordered or extra statements.
  - **Root cause:** Compiler optimization is pattern-based, not a full general-purpose loop optimizer.
  - **Fix:** Keep matcher strict and optimize known hot patterns first.
  - **Prevention:** Add new fusion patterns intentionally with tests; do not assume all equivalent loops are currently optimized.

- **Gotcha:** Benchmark conclusions can drift if non-comparable workloads are mixed.
  - **Symptom:** Performance claims vary run-to-run when benchmark mix or warmup conditions change.
  - **Root cause:** Startup overhead and workload differences dominate tiny tasks.
  - **Fix:** Use the cross-language benchmark harness consistently and compare the same scripts across Ruff/Python/Go.
  - **Prevention:** Keep benchmark table generation tied to one command and one benchmark set per report.

## Things I Learned
- JIT correctness invariants (SSA/block sealing) are as release-critical as throughput gains; performance changes must be paired with stability sweeps.
- In this codebase, high-confidence optimization work means: targeted tests first, full suite second, cross-language benchmark last.
- Release readiness should include metadata synchronization (`Cargo.toml`, changelog, roadmap, README), not just green tests.
- Canonical-pattern fusion delivers meaningful wins quickly without requiring broad IR redesign.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** Cranelift JIT panics related to block sealing invariants (already-sealed / incorrect sealing order).
- **Repro steps:** Run `cargo test` after JIT/optimizer edits; failures appear in JIT-focused tests.
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** Focused on JIT control-flow/sealing paths in `src/jit.rs`; iterated with targeted runs then full suite.
- **Final diagnosis:** Block sealing was performed at inconsistent points for some control-flow shapes; corrected ordering removed panics.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Add focused regression tests that isolate problematic sealing shapes (nested loops/branches) at JIT translation boundaries.
- [ ] Expand hashmap fusion matcher coverage incrementally with benchmark-backed additions.
- [ ] Automate release checklist into a single script (build + tests + benchmark + metadata checks).
