# Ruff Field Notes — v0.12 REPL Improvements Initial Slice

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Session:** 23:08 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / pending
**Scope:** Implemented the next highest-priority incomplete v0.12.0 track (REPL improvements) with completion, highlighting, multiline validation, `.help <function>` docs, tests, and release evidence updates.

---

## What I Changed
- Extended src/repl.rs with a Rustyline helper that now provides:
  - tab completion for REPL commands and builtin function names
  - command-oriented line highlighting
  - validator-backed multiline continuation handling
- Added `.help <function>` command handling in REPL command mode.
- Added dedicated function-help output for common builtins (`print`, `input`, `len`, `range`, `read_file`, `http_get`).
- Added focused REPL tests for multiline continuation/completion detection behavior.
- Updated release evidence docs:
  - ROADMAP.md
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - README.md
  - notes/README.md

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Rustyline helper wiring requires changing the editor type from the default alias to an explicit helper-aware `Editor<Helper, History>`.
  - **Symptom:** Cannot install non-unit helper when using default editor alias.
  - **Root cause:** `DefaultEditor` uses unit helper type and does not support setting a custom helper instance.
  - **Fix:** Switched to explicit editor generic with helper and default history.
  - **Prevention:** Prefer explicit editor generics any time completion/highlighting/validation features are needed.

## Things I Learned
- Multi-line UX improves significantly when input completeness logic is shared between REPL buffering and Rustyline validation.
- A command-oriented highlight strategy is a low-risk first step that improves readability without introducing parser-level colorization complexity.
- Lightweight `.help <function>` support is an effective bridge before full API-doc generator integration.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** None.
- **Validation run:** `cargo test repl -- --nocapture` and piped smoke run for `.help len` in `ruff repl`.
- **Final diagnosis:** REPL slice compiles and behaves as expected for initial roadmap scope.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Expand `.help <function>` to include richer signatures/examples pulled from native function metadata.
- [ ] Add context-aware completion for in-scope user variables/functions in the active REPL session.
- [ ] Consider token-aware syntax highlighting once parser-backed incremental lexing support is available.
