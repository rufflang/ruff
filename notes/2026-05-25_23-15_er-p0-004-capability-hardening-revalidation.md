# Ruff Field Notes — ER-P0-004 capability hardening revalidation

**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Session:** 23:15 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / working tree (pre-commit)
**Scope:** Revalidated untrusted capability guardrails and security boundary contracts, then aligned operator docs with deterministic outbound-policy diagnostics.

---

## What I Changed
- Re-ran security boundary suites:
  - `cargo test --test native_api_security_boundaries`
  - `cargo test --test runtime_security`
- Re-ran docs high-risk policy consistency suite:
  - `cargo test --test docs_policy_consistency_contract`
- Updated `docs/NATIVE_API_SECURITY_POSTURE.md` network policy section to document deterministic diagnostic strings for:
  - invalid `RUFF_NET_DESTINATION_POLICY`
  - strict-mode blocked destination errors (`blocked by outbound destination policy`)
- Marked `ER-P0-004` complete with evidence in `docs/V1_0_ENTERPRISE_READINESS_ENHANCEMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Policy hardening work can regress docs even when tests are green.
  - **Symptom:** runtime behavior exposes deterministic strings but docs omit exact operator-facing wording.
  - **Root cause:** docs lag runtime tests when diagnostics are tightened.
  - **Fix:** capture exact error text in posture docs when boundary diagnostics are contractual.
  - **Prevention:** pair `native_api_security_boundaries` passes with a docs diff for operator-facing diagnostics.

## Things I Learned
- Security boundary and runtime security suites are stable on this snapshot.
- Explicitly documenting deterministic diagnostic strings improves incident triage and policy rollout confidence.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** none in this loop.
- **Repro steps:** n/a.
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** command outputs only.
- **Final diagnosis:** ER-P0-004 acceptance criteria met.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Keep `docs/NATIVE_API_SECURITY_POSTURE.md` synchronized with any future `network_policy.rs` diagnostic string changes.
- [ ] Re-run these suites whenever capability policy defaults are touched.
