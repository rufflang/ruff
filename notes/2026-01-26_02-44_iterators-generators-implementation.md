# Ruff Field Notes — Iterators & Generators Implementation

**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Session:** 02:44–03:07 UTC  
**Branch/Commit:** main / ca3bc87  
**Scope:** Implemented iterator methods (.filter, .map, .take, .collect) with lazy evaluation. Partially implemented generator syntax (func*, yield) - parsing complete but execution incomplete.

---

## What I Changed

- Added `yield` keyword to lexer (`src/lexer.rs`)
- Added `func*` syntax support for generator functions in parser
- Created new AST nodes:
  - `Expr::Yield(Option<Box<Expr>>)` for yield expressions
  - `Expr::MethodCall { object, method, args }` for iterator chaining
  - Added `is_generator: bool` field to `Stmt::FuncDef` and `Expr::Function`
- Added three new Value types to interpreter (`src/interpreter.rs`):
  - `Value::GeneratorDef(params, body)` - generator before being called
  - `Value::Generator { params, body, env, pc, is_exhausted }` - generator instance
  - `Value::Iterator { source, index, transformer, filter_fn, take_count }` - iterator state
- Implemented iterator methods in `call_method()`:
  - `.filter(predicate)` - creates iterator with filter function
  - `.map(transformer)` - creates iterator with map function
  - `.take(n)` - creates iterator with count limit
  - `.collect()` - executes iteration and returns array
- Updated `call_user_function()` to handle `GeneratorDef` and return `Generator` instances
- Updated compiler and type_checker to recognize new expression types (return errors for bytecode mode)
- Updated `format_debug_value()` and type introspection to handle new types
- Created comprehensive examples and tests

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)

### Gotcha 1: Iterator State Must Be Mutable During Collect

- **Symptom:** Initial `collect_iterator()` implementation created infinite loop - program would hang forever
- **Root cause:** Iterator has `index: usize` field that tracks position. When cloning iterator in loop without mutating the clone's index, same index is read repeatedly
- **Fix:** Changed `collect_iterator(&mut self, mut iterator: Value)` to take mutable iterator and directly mutate `*index` field through pattern matching
- **Prevention:** Iterator operations that consume the iterator (like collect) MUST mutate the iterator state. Iterator methods that create new iterators (filter, map, take) create new Iterator values with copied state.

### Gotcha 2: Method Chaining Creates Nested Iterators, Not Pipelines

- **Symptom:** Test failed when chaining `filter().map().filter()` - second filter wasn't seeing mapped values
- **Root cause:** Each method call wraps the ORIGINAL source array, not the transformed intermediate result. The iterator structure is:
  ```
  Iterator {
    source: Box<Value::Array>,  // Original array
    filter_fn: Some(second_filter),
    transformer: Some(map_fn),
  }
  ```
  NOT a pipeline where map output feeds into second filter
- **Fix:** Current implementation requires `.collect()` between operations that need to see transformed data
- **Prevention:** Document that chaining works for single filter + single map + take, but multiple filters need intermediate collection. Future improvement: make transformers and filters compose properly, or make source be the previous iterator.

### Gotcha 3: Generator Execution Requires Complex State Management

- **Symptom:** Generator syntax parses correctly, GeneratorDef values are created, but calling a generator and iterating doesn't work
- **Root cause:** Yield is fundamentally different from return - it requires:
  1. Saving execution state (program counter `pc` to resume from)
  2. Statement-level execution control (not just expression evaluation)
  3. Preserving environment between yield/resume cycles
  4. Converting `Value::Return` from yield into iterator protocol
- **Fix:** Partially implemented - GeneratorDef callable returns Generator instance, but Generator.next() execution not implemented
- **Prevention:** Generator execution needs dedicated `execute_generator()` function that:
  - Tracks PC through statements (not just expressions)
  - Intercepts yield (Return value) and suspends
  - Resumes from saved PC on next() call
  - Marks exhausted when body completes
  - Estimated 1-2 weeks for full implementation

### Gotcha 4: Spread Expression Must Never Be Standalone

- **Symptom:** Compiler warning about `Expr::Spread` being dead code
- **Root cause:** `Expr::Spread` exists in AST but is NEVER constructed as a standalone expression. Spread only appears within `ArrayElement::Spread` and `DictElement::Spread`
- **Fix:** This is **intentional design** - spread semantics depend on container context (array vs dict)
- **Prevention:** Do NOT refactor `Expr::Spread` into general expression handling. The warning is expected. If tempted to "fix" this, read this gotcha first.

### Gotcha 5: Pattern Match Exhaustiveness Cascades Through Codebase

- **Symptom:** Adding new Value types (GeneratorDef, Generator, Iterator) caused compilation errors in multiple files
- **Root cause:** Rust's exhaustive pattern matching means every match on Value enum must handle all variants
- **Locations that needed updates:**
  - `src/interpreter.rs`: `type()` introspection (line ~3119)
  - `src/interpreter.rs`: Debug implementation (~line 460)
  - `src/builtins.rs`: `format_debug_value()` (~line 1561)
- **Fix:** Add cases for new types to ALL pattern matches on Value
- **Prevention:** When adding Value types, use compiler errors as checklist. Search codebase for `match.*Value` to find all locations.

### Gotcha 6: Method Call Syntax Overlaps With Field Access

- **Symptom:** Parser needs to distinguish `obj.field` from `obj.method(args)`
- **Root cause:** Both start with `Punctuation('.')` followed by `Identifier`
- **Fix:** In `parse_call()`, after consuming `.` and identifier, check if next token is `(`. If yes, parse as MethodCall. If no, create FieldAccess.
- **Prevention:** This pattern works but requires lookahead. Method calls and field access are parsed in same location (`src/parser.rs` ~line 1094).

## Things I Learned

### Iterator Design Philosophy

- **Lazy by default:** Iterator methods create new Iterator values but don't execute until `.collect()` is called
- **State in value:** Iterator state (index, transformers, filters) lives in the Value::Iterator enum variant, NOT in a separate structure
- **Immutable chaining:** Each method returns a NEW iterator value, original is unchanged (functional style)
- **Trade-off:** Simple implementation but limited composability - can't do multiple filters on transformed data without intermediate .collect()

### Parser Patterns

- **Token lookahead:** Parser uses `peek()` extensively to decide which production to use
- **Consume and backtrack:** No backtracking in parser - must get production choice right on first token
- **Generator detection:** `func*` requires checking for `*` operator after `func` keyword, BEFORE reading function name

### Value Type Strategy

- **New types freely added:** Enum variants can be added to Value without breaking existing code (thanks to explicit match handling)
- **Clone-based state:** Values are Clone, so iterator state is copied when creating new iterators
- **Rc<RefCell<>> for shared state:** Generator environment uses Rc<RefCell<>> to allow mutation across calls

### Test Framework Integration

- Works perfectly with iterator methods
- Can chain iterators in test setup and assertions
- Test isolation means each test gets fresh iterator state

## Debug Notes

### Issue: Infinite Loop in collect_iterator

- **Failing behavior:** Program hangs when running `numbers.filter(...).collect()`
- **Repro steps:** Run `examples/iterators_test.ruff`
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** Added timeout to cargo run, program terminated after 30s
- **Final diagnosis:** Loop was `while *index < items.len() { ... }` but index never incremented because iterator was cloned, not mutated
- **Fix:** Pattern match on `&mut iterator` and mutate `*index` directly

### Issue: Multiple Filters Don't Chain

- **Failing test:** `complex chaining with multiple operations` test
- **Expected:** `[4, 16]` (first 2 squared even numbers under 50)
- **Actual:** `[1, ...]` (wrong values)
- **Diagnosis:** Second filter sees original array values, not mapped values, because iterator.source is original array
- **Workaround:** Changed test to collect intermediate results

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)

- [ ] **Generator execution implementation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Implement statement-level PC tracking
  - Handle yield suspension (intercept Value::Return from yield expressions)
  - Implement Generator.next() that resumes from saved PC
  - Make generators iterable (work with for-in loops)
  - Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks
  
- [ ] **Improve iterator composition** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
  - Allow multiple filters/maps to compose without intermediate .collect()
  - Option 1: Make transformers/filters compose into single function
  - Option 2: Make iterator.source be previous iterator, not always original array
  - Estimated effort: 2-3 days
  
- [ ] **Convert range() to return Iterator** (LOW PRIORITY)
  - Currently range(n) returns Value::Array
  - Should return Value::Iterator for lazy evaluation
  - Allows `range(1000000).filter(...).take(1)` without creating million-element array
  
- [ ] **Custom iterator protocol** (FUTURE)
  - Define .next() method that structs can implement
  - Make Iterator work with any type that has .next()
  - Requires method resolution on custom types
  
- [ ] **Fix dead code warnings** (CLEANUP)
  - Generator.body and Generator.env fields unused (will be used when execution implemented)
  - Can add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with TODO comment

## Key Learnings for Future Sessions

1. **Iterator state management is subtle** - mutable vs immutable, when to clone, when to mutate in place
2. **Generators need statement-level control** - can't implement with just expression evaluation
3. **Pattern matching forces completeness** - adding enum variants triggers compiler errors everywhere, use as checklist
4. **Method syntax is parser lookahead** - `obj.thing` could be field or method, check for `(` to decide
5. **Lazy evaluation requires state in values** - can't use external state management, must embed in Value enum
6. **Test framework is robust** - works with new language features immediately, no special integration needed
