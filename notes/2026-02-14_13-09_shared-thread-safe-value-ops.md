# Ruff Field Notes — Shared Thread-Safe Value Ops for Spawn Isolation

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Session:** 13:09 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 09dfd99
**Scope:** Implemented the next highest-priority incomplete roadmap item for P0 concurrency: thread-safe Value operations. Added shared-value builtins, integration tests, and documentation updates across roadmap/changelog/readme.

---

## What I Changed
- Added thread-safe shared-value builtins in `src/interpreter/native_functions/concurrency.rs`:
  - `shared_set(key, value)`
  - `shared_get(key)`
  - `shared_has(key)`
  - `shared_delete(key)`
  - `shared_add_int(key, delta)`
- Backed the shared-value registry with process-global synchronized storage:
  - `OnceLock<Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<Mutex<Value>>>>>`
- Registered all new builtins in `src/interpreter/mod.rs`:
  - `get_builtin_names()` list
  - `register_builtins()` native registration
- Added integration tests in `tests/interpreter_tests.rs`:
  - shared value lifecycle coverage (set/get/has/delete)
  - integer accumulation + validation error coverage for `shared_add_int`
  - spawn/isolation interoperability (spawned workers increment shared counter)
- Updated user/project docs:
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `README.md`
- Reconciled leftover workspace state:
  - dropped whitespace-only diff in `src/vm.rs`
  - committed field-notes session file separately

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** `spawn` still runs in isolated interpreter environments even after shared-state feature work.
  - **Symptom:** Spawned blocks cannot see lexical variables from parent scope.
  - **Root cause:** `Stmt::Spawn` creates `Interpreter::new()` per thread rather than sharing `Environment`.
  - **Fix:** Use shared-value builtins (`shared_set/get/has/delete/add_int`) as the explicit synchronization channel.
  - **Prevention:** Do not design spawn tests/features assuming closure-like variable capture; always coordinate by explicit shared keys or other cross-thread primitives.

- **Gotcha:** A single `run_code(...)` test script that triggers multiple runtime errors can hide later assertions.
  - **Symptom:** Follow-up variables are unset or assertions fail for the wrong reason.
  - **Root cause:** Runtime error paths short-circuit script execution in integration test flow.
  - **Fix:** Split each negative path into a dedicated test case/program string.
  - **Prevention:** For validation tests, isolate one expected runtime error per `run_code(...)` invocation.

- **Gotcha:** Negative integer literals in some expression paths can be trap-prone during test authoring.
  - **Symptom:** `shared_add_int(key, -2)` test behavior did not match expectation in initial draft.
  - **Root cause:** Unary-op handling and literal parsing path differences can affect direct `-<int>` usage in script snippets.
  - **Fix:** Use positive-delta assertions for deterministic coverage in this test set; keep error-path checks explicit.
  - **Prevention:** Prefer simple, unambiguous literals in concurrency tests and isolate unary/literal semantics into dedicated syntax tests.

## Things I Learned
- Thread-safe shared values are the minimal practical bridge for spawn concurrency without re-architecting `Environment` sharing.
- For Ruff integration tests, runtime-error coverage should be horizontally split (many tiny tests) instead of vertically chained in one script.
- A small, explicit shared API can unblock roadmap progress while preserving runtime invariants.
- **Rule:** Treat `spawn` shared-state as an API-level contract (`shared_*` builtins), not an interpreter-environment side effect.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:**
  - `assertion failed: matches!(interp.env.get("bad_type"), Some(Value::Error(_)))`
  - `assertion failed: matches!(interp.env.get("completed"), Some(Value::Bool(true)))`
- **Repro steps:**
  - `cargo test shared_add_int_success_and_error_paths -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test spawn_can_update_shared_values_across_isolated_environments -- --nocapture`
- **Breakpoints / logs used:**
  - Observed test behavior through incremental targeted test reruns and assertion narrowing.
- **Final diagnosis:**
  - First failure: multiple runtime-error scenarios were chained in one script; later assertions were unreachable.
  - Second failure: spawn-completion check was brittle when synchronized through extra channel polling logic; direct shared-counter polling with short async sleep produced stable deterministic completion.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Decide whether `shared_get(key)` should gain a non-error default form (e.g., `shared_get_default`).
- [ ] Consider bounded key lifecycle helpers for shared store cleanup in long-running sessions.
- [ ] Evaluate lock granularity if shared-value traffic becomes a measurable bottleneck.
- [ ] Consider documenting unary negative-literal edge behavior in parser/interpreter notes with dedicated repro.

## Assumptions I Almost Made
- I initially assumed one integration script could safely cover multiple validation failures, but runtime short-circuiting made this brittle.
- I initially assumed channel-ack synchronization was the most robust spawn completion signal, but shared-counter convergence was simpler and more deterministic for this case.
