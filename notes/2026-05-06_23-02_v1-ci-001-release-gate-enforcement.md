# Ruff Field Notes — V1-CI-001 release gate enforcement

**Date:** 2026-05-06
**Session:** 23:02 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / e7ca508
**Scope:** Implemented `V1-CI-001` by adding release-gate CI enforcement on PR/main and release tags, plus a shared gate script and stability handling for socket-restricted environments.

---

## What I Changed
- Added `.github/workflows/ci-release-gate.yml` to enforce:
  - `cargo fmt --check`
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
  - `bash scripts/release_gate.sh`
- Updated `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml` with a `release-gate` job that must pass before artifact build/publish.
- Added `scripts/release_gate.sh` as a shared release-gate command that:
  - runs `cargo test --lib -- --test-threads=1`
  - runs integration tests, with socket-bound `serve` tests gated by `RUFF_ENABLE_SOCKET_TESTS=1`
  - runs key gate integrations (`native_api_security_boundaries`, `package_module_workflow_integration`, `vm_interpreter_parity_surfaces`)
  - skips optional `cargo audit`/`cargo deny` when tools are unavailable
- Hardened network round-trip unit tests in `src/interpreter/native_functions/mod.rs` to skip gracefully when local socket bind is denied by environment policy.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` for completion/reporting of `V1-CI-001`.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Socket-bound tests can fail with `PermissionDenied` in restricted local/sandbox environments.
  - **Symptom:** Tests panic while allocating ephemeral `127.0.0.1:0` ports (`Operation not permitted`).
  - **Root cause:** Host/sandbox policy blocks local bind even though the test logic is correct.
  - **Fix:** Gate socket-heavy integration tests with `RUFF_ENABLE_SOCKET_TESTS=1` in CI and add graceful skip behavior in unit tests when bind permission is denied.
  - **Prevention:** Keep release-gate scripts environment-aware and explicitly control socket test execution mode between local and CI contexts.

## Things I Learned
- `V1-CI-001` can be completed without waiting for the broader `V1-BASE-002` full release script scope, as long as merge/release blocking checks are enforced in workflows.
- Running socket tests both in unit and integration layers needs explicit policy; otherwise CI/local parity can look flaky even when runtime code is unchanged.
- For this repo, one practical gate split is:
  - always-run deterministic tests
  - opt-in socket tests for trusted CI environments

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** `PermissionDenied` while binding ephemeral TCP/UDP ports in network and serve integration tests.
- **Repro steps:** `bash scripts/release_gate.sh` in sandboxed environment without socket permissions.
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** Direct `cargo test` reruns for failing test target and full-suite reruns with/without socket-sensitive subsets.
- **Final diagnosis:** Failure was environment policy, not runtime correctness.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] If CI runners ever enforce stricter network policies, add explicit `#[ignore]` + gated job strategy for socket integration tests.
- [ ] When implementing `V1-BASE-002`, decide whether `cargo run -- test` should be a hard gate or remain outside release-critical CI in current baseline.
