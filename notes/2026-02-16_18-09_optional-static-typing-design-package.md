# Ruff Field Notes — optional static typing design package

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Session:** 18:09 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 0b6c8c4
**Scope:** Completed the next roadmap item after release hardening by delivering the v0.10 exploratory optional static typing design package and synchronizing roadmap/changelog/readme status.

---

## What I Changed
- Added new design document: `docs/OPTIONAL_TYPING_DESIGN.md`.
- Documented Stage 1 annotation surface proposal (functions, variables, collection generics) and parser/type-check impact notes.
- Documented Stage 2 optional runtime type-check mode contract, opt-in behavior model, and deterministic type-error shape targets.
- Documented Stage 3 typed-JIT optimization boundaries with explicit in-scope candidates and deferred non-goals.
- Added migration/compatibility posture and open decisions to keep future implementation constrained and backward-compatible.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` to mark the Optional Static Typing Design Package as complete and to point future chats to the consolidated design doc.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (`Unreleased` → `Added`) and `README.md` project status section for synchronized release communication.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Inserting a new same-level markdown heading into a long bullet stream can accidentally re-scope all following bullets
  - **Symptom:** Existing release-hardening bullets appear visually under the newly added typing heading
  - **Root cause:** Markdown section ownership is determined purely by heading boundaries; no implicit return to prior heading
  - **Fix:** Reorder headings so the new section is placed before/after the full existing section intentionally
  - **Prevention:** After docs edits, re-read the first 30-50 lines around new headings to verify section ownership

## Things I Learned
- A design-only roadmap item can be treated as a full deliverable when it has: concrete syntax surface, runtime contract boundaries, migration guidance, and explicit non-goals.
- Keeping `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` synchronized in the same change avoids status drift for exploratory work just as much as for code work.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- No compile/test failures were involved because this item is documentation/design only.
- Validation used focused diff inspection for just the changed files.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] When implementation starts, align parser AST node design with the annotation surface in `docs/OPTIONAL_TYPING_DESIGN.md`.
- [ ] Define exact CLI/config switch precedence for type-check mode before wiring runtime enforcement.
- [ ] Add implementation-phase contract tests for future type-check error shapes once code lands.
