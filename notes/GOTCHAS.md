## Parser & Syntax

### Expression precedence is NOT inferred
- **Problem:** Parser/evaluator behavior can look "wrong" when new syntax is added without explicit precedence placement.
- **Rule:** New expression forms and operators must be wired into the existing precedence chain intentionally; Ruff does not infer precedence from token shape.
- **Why:** The parser is hand-rolled with explicit parse stages and lookahead.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-25_14-30_destructuring-spread-implementation.md)

### Spread (`...`) is container-context only
- **Problem:** Treating spread as a standalone expression leads to invalid mental models and dead-end refactors.
- **Rule:** Spread is valid only inside `ArrayElement::Spread` and `DictElement::Spread`, not as a general `Expr`.
- **Why:** Semantics depend on container context (array flatten/concat vs dict merge).

(Discovered during: 2026-01-25_14-30_destructuring-spread-implementation.md)

### `Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None` are contextual identifiers, not lexer keywords
- **Problem:** Turning these into keywords breaks `match case` parsing and can hang parse flows.
- **Rule:** Keep them tokenized as identifiers and interpret contextually in parser/evaluator logic.
- **Why:** Pattern matching expects identifier tokens in case arms.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-25_17-30_result-option-types-COMPLETED.md)

### Parser hardening must preserve accepted compatibility syntax unless intentionally deprecated
- **Problem:** Replacing permissive `advance()` parsing with strict `expect_*` checks can silently regress accepted syntax (for example `let x = 1` or `else if ...` chains).
- **Rule:** When tightening parser diagnostics, explicitly preserve legacy-accepted forms or document and test intentional deprecations before changing behavior.
- **Why:** Compatibility regressions can surface as runtime-level failures (empty/partial AST execution) far from the parser change point.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_23-48_v1-par-001-parse-diagnostics.md)

### Multi-character operators require explicit lexer lookahead
- **Problem:** Operators like `...` fragment into punctuation tokens when lookahead logic is incomplete.
- **Rule:** Any multi-character operator must have dedicated lookahead path in lexer tokenization.
- **Why:** Lexer is character-driven and does not auto-compose operator tokens.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-25_14-30_destructuring-spread-implementation.md)

### Identifier token column semantics are an editor-contract surface
- **Problem:** LSP definition/hover/references/rename lookups can break after lexer refactors even when token kinds remain correct.
- **Rule:** Preserve legacy identifier `Token.column` semantics (used by downstream `column - name_len` start-column math) unless all LSP symbol helpers are migrated together.
- **Why:** Existing LSP symbol tooling derives cursor containment from identifier token columns, so location-field drift causes false misses.

## Runtime / Evaluator

### Variable scope in scripts is global-by-default
- **Problem:** Reusing variable names across top-level blocks causes state bleed in tests and scripts.
- **Rule:** Assume script-level assignments mutate shared global scope unless inside function boundaries.
- **Implication:** Use unique names or function wrappers for isolation in integration tests.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-27_07-46_phase2-vm-optimizations.md)

### Native dispatch and declaration can drift independently
- **Problem:** Builtins may appear declared but still fail at runtime if dispatcher wiring is missing.
- **Rule:** Treat declaration, registration, and dispatch handling as separate required surfaces.
- **Implication:** Any builtin change needs end-to-end contract tests (module + dispatcher + runtime behavior).

(Discovered during: 2026-02-15_09-18_release-hardening-alias-api-contract.md)

### VM builtin name registration does not bootstrap constants
- **Problem:** VM runs can report undefined `PI`, `E`, or `null` even when builtin globals seem initialized.
- **Rule:** Treat constant injection as a separate bootstrap contract from native builtin-name registration.
- **Implication:** When touching VM startup/bootstrap, assert both callable builtins and constant globals are present.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-05_10-29_vm-example-compatibility-followthrough.md)

### Method support can silently split between call paths
- **Problem:** A method can appear implemented but still fail in normal `obj.method(...)` usage.
- **Rule:** Keep method behavior wired to the active `Expr::MethodCall` path and do not leave logic only in legacy field-access call sugar branches.
- **Implication:** Verify both interpreter `call_method(...)` and VM `FieldGet`/native-call handling when adding methods for non-struct `Value` types.

(Discovered during: 2026-04-29_17-02_image-method-dispatch-parity.md)

### HTTP route matching must ignore query strings
- **Problem:** Exact/parameterized routes can fail when handlers are matched against full URLs containing `?query=...`.
- **Rule:** Split request URL into path and query first, then route-match using normalized path only.
- **Implication:** Keep request metadata (`path`, `raw_path`, `query`, `query_string`) explicit and parity-aligned across interpreter and VM runtimes.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-05_11-17_http-query-route-hardening.md)

### Control-flow truthiness must explicitly handle integer zero
- **Problem:** Missing-key/fallback branches can silently execute incorrectly when condition values are numeric sentinels.
- **Rule:** `Int(0)` must be falsey and non-zero ints truthy in both `Stmt::If` and `Stmt::While` evaluation paths.
- **Implication:** Keep truthiness logic parity between `src/interpreter/mod.rs` and `src/interpreter/legacy_full.rs`, and guard with dedicated regression tests.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-05_22-20_ai-sdk-runtime-truthiness-and-test-run-gotchas.md)

### Strict-arity hardening must preserve legacy fallback contracts unless intentionally changed
- **Problem:** Rejecting extra args can accidentally alter established missing/invalid-arg behavior.
- **Rule:** Add explicit extra-arg rejection while preserving existing fallback semantics unless contract change is deliberate.
- **Implication:** Tests should assert both strict-arity and compatibility fallback behavior.

(Discovered during: 2026-02-16_20-23_release-hardening-strict-arity-follow-through-slices.md)

### Native `Value::Error` can be data, while undefined identifiers are fatal
- **Problem:** Treating every `Value::Error` as an immediate statement-level halt breaks native helpers that intentionally return error values for callers to inspect.
- **Rule:** Undefined identifier lookup must produce `Undefined variable: <name>` and stop execution, but `let x := native_call(...)` must still be allowed to bind a native `Value::Error` unless that API is intentionally changed.
- **Implication:** Runtime-error hardening should distinguish language semantic errors from native error-as-value contracts before changing `let`/assignment behavior.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_17-07_undefined-identifier-runtime-errors.md)

### Promise receivers are single-consumer
- **Problem:** Re-awaiting or re-aggregating promise handles can fail if cached result checks are skipped.
- **Rule:** Aggregation helpers must short-circuit on cached completion before touching receiver paths.
- **Implication:** `Promise.all`/`await_all` optimizations must preserve single-consumer safety.

(Discovered during: 2026-02-14_10-10_promise-cache-reuse-and-parallel-map-overhead.md)

### Shared state is process-global
- **Problem:** Tests interfere when shared keys are reused.
- **Rule:** Use unique shared keys per test and clean up deterministically.
- **Implication:** Parallel tests require namespacing discipline for `shared_*` APIs.

(Discovered during: 2026-02-14_13-09_shared-thread-safe-value-ops.md)

### SSG helper contracts are compatibility surfaces
- **Problem:** Throughput refactors can silently break checksum, stage-metric key, or output-path invariants.
- **Rule:** Preserve benchmark-facing contracts (`checksum`, file counts, stage keys) while optimizing internals.
- **Implication:** SSG performance work must include contract regressions, not only speed checks.

(Discovered during: 2026-03-12_10-43_ssg-read-render-write-fusion-follow-through.md)

## Compiler / VM / JIT

### `StoreVar`/`StoreGlobal` are PEEK-semantics, not POP
- **Problem:** Missing explicit `Pop` after assignment/pattern-binding pollutes stack and breaks loop/JIT invariants.
- **Rule:** Statement-level assignment paths must enforce stack hygiene explicitly.
- **Why:** Store opcodes keep top-of-stack value by design.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-28_18-50_compiler-stack-pop-fix.md)

### VM opcode semantics may have duplicate execution arms
- **Problem:** Fixing only the primary VM loop can leave nested bytecode/JIT-call execution with old behavior.
- **Rule:** Search every `OpCode::<Name>` arm and route shared semantics through one helper when changing opcode behavior.
- **Implication:** Indexing changes must cover `IndexGet`, `IndexGetInPlace`, optimized local paths, and nested bytecode-call paths.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_12-25_vm-map-missing-key-runtime-errors.md)

### Script JIT can bypass runtime error semantics
- **Problem:** Top-level script JIT may return a default value for opcodes whose checked VM path would report a runtime error.
- **Rule:** Do not admit opcodes into script JIT unless the JIT implementation preserves the same error semantics as the bytecode VM.
- **Implication:** Undefined-name work gates `LoadVar`/`LoadGlobal` out of script JIT until JIT variable lookup has explicit parity tests, and strict-unary semantics now gate `Negate`/`Not` admission until JIT parity coverage exists.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_17-07_undefined-identifier-runtime-errors.md, 2026-05-06_21-06_v1-run-003-invalid-operation-errors.md)

### Interpreter named nested functions are not closure expressions
- **Problem:** A nested `func name(...) { ... }` may not capture local variables the way an anonymous `func(...) { ... }` expression does.
- **Rule:** Use function expressions when a test or example requires closure-captured locals.
- **Implication:** Captured-state parity tests should use `binding := func(...) { ... }` unless the selected task is explicitly about named nested function capture.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_12-25_vm-map-missing-key-runtime-errors.md)

### Dead-code elimination must remap all index-based metadata
- **Problem:** Jump targets/handlers/source-map entries become invalid after instruction removal.
- **Rule:** Build old→new index mapping and rewrite every metadata surface carrying instruction indices.
- **Implication:** Optimizer edits require holistic metadata audits, not opcode-only updates.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-27_07-46_phase2-vm-optimizations.md)

### New modules must be declared in both crate roots
- **Problem:** `unresolved import` appears when module is wired in `main.rs` but not `lib.rs` (or vice versa).
- **Rule:** Ruff uses binary+library crate roots; add module declarations to both when introducing new modules.
- **Implication:** Module-split refactors should include dual-root compile checks.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-27_07-46_phase2-vm-optimizations.md)

### Cranelift block sealing and terminators are correctness-critical
- **Problem:** Misordered sealing or missing terminators causes verifier failures and invalid SSA graphs.
- **Rule:** Ensure each basic block terminates and seal in control-flow-safe order.
- **Implication:** JIT edits require explicit CFG reasoning, not local opcode translation only.

(Discovered during: 2026-01-28_04-08_jit-execution-success.md)

## CLI & Tooling

### `cargo test` only accepts one positional test filter
- **Problem:** Supplying multiple positional filters leads to command misuse and misleading failures.
- **Rule:** Use one positional filter; pass additional selection logic via module path or `-- --nocapture`/other flags.
- **Implication:** Keep repro commands minimal and exact in notes/tests.

(Discovered during: 2026-02-17_18-48_io-strict-arity-hardening.md)

### `zip = 0.5` unix permission helpers do not encode symlink file type bits
- **Problem:** Tests that create zip entries with `FileOptions::unix_permissions(0o120777)` may still produce normal files, causing symlink-policy regressions to be untested.
- **Rule:** For symlink-metadata tests, verify `ZipFile::unix_mode()` in the fixture or patch central-directory metadata (`version_made_by` host + external attributes) explicitly.
- **Implication:** Do not assume unix permission setters alone can generate true symlink zip entries under `zip = 0.5`.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_22-19_v1-sec-001-unzip-hardening.md)

### Repository shell guards should remain Bash 3 compatible for local macOS runs
- **Problem:** CI/helper scripts can work in GitHub Actions but fail locally with `mapfile: command not found`.
- **Rule:** Prefer portable `while read` loops over Bash-4-only helpers (for example `mapfile`) in repo-level scripts.
- **Implication:** Validate new `.github/scripts/*.sh` locally on macOS before relying on CI-only execution confidence.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_11-30_field-notes-ci-guard.md)

### Socket-bound test gates need explicit environment policy
- **Problem:** Full test/gate runs can fail in restricted sandboxes with `PermissionDenied` when binding ephemeral TCP/UDP ports.
- **Rule:** Keep socket-heavy integration tests explicitly gated by environment intent (for example `RUFF_ENABLE_SOCKET_TESTS=1` in CI) and make unit tests skip gracefully when bind permissions are denied.
- **Implication:** Separate correctness failures from environment policy failures so release gates stay meaningful and reproducible.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_23-02_v1-ci-001-release-gate-enforcement.md)

### Benchmark harness paths are sensitive to working directory
- **Problem:** Running bench commands outside repo-root can resolve fixtures/scripts incorrectly.
- **Rule:** Normalize CWD assumptions and prefer explicit tmp/artifact roots for harnesses.
- **Implication:** Bench tooling changes should be validated with non-root invocation paths.

(Discovered during: 2026-02-13_18-52_bench-cross-cwd-gotcha.md)

### Full-suite timing assertions are brittle under load
- **Problem:** Throughput/timing tests that assert monotonic runtime behavior flake in CI and loaded local environments.
- **Rule:** Assert deterministic correctness signals (checksums/counts/non-negative timing) instead of strict timing trends.
- **Implication:** Performance tests should detect regressions by contract, not raw wall-clock ordering.

(Discovered during: 2026-03-19_07-47_ssg-rayon-pool-cache-and-timing-test-stability.md)

### Top-level example harnesses must explicitly separate automation-safe and interactive flows
- **Problem:** One-shot example sweeps can fail or hang on interactive/server/network demos.
- **Rule:** Keep a clear automation contract (non-benchmark, non-interactive) and guard long-running examples.
- **Implication:** Use a deterministic smoke target for CI/local sweeps and validate interactive flows separately.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-05_10-29_vm-example-compatibility-followthrough.md)

### Animated GIF to WebP conversion depends on external `gif2webp`
- **Problem:** Animated conversion may fail at runtime despite valid Ruff arguments.
- **Rule:** `gif_to_webp(...)` requires the `gif2webp` CLI tool to be installed and available in `PATH`.
- **Implication:** If animated conversion is a product requirement, verify `command -v gif2webp` in setup/CI and keep fallback/error messaging explicit.

(Discovered during: 2026-04-29_17-17_animated-gif-to-webp-conversion.md)

### `test-run` initialization is setup-boundary driven
- **Problem:** Tests can fail with undefined symbols even though the same file works under normal `run` execution.
- **Rule:** Put imports/bootstrap code needed by tests inside `test_setup`; do not rely on top-level import execution.
- **Implication:** When diagnosing `test-run` failures, verify setup/import timing before changing runtime internals.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-05_22-20_ai-sdk-runtime-truthiness-and-test-run-gotchas.md)

### Cross-project local preview should be a CLI primitive, not a one-off script
- **Problem:** Script-level server examples can depend on runtime-mode behavior and become project-specific workarounds.
- **Rule:** If a workflow should be available to all users, expose it as `ruff <subcommand>` (for example `ruff serve`) instead of per-project helper scripts.
- **Implication:** Prefer CLI-level shared capabilities for portability and lower maintenance; keep script examples as optional convenience only.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_10-09_cli-serve-command-holistic-preview.md)

### `tiny_http` header field comparisons are type-sensitive
- **Problem:** Header matching code can fail to compile when comparing `HeaderField` values directly with `&str` using methods that expect `AsciiStr`.
- **Rule:** In dynamic/header-name helper code, normalize the header field to string form before case-insensitive comparison against `&str`.
- **Implication:** For serve/header refactors in `src/serve_http.rs`, verify header lookup helpers compile before broader protocol changes.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_11-06_cli-serve-universal-hardening-followthrough.md)

### Static-serve MIME policy must live in production module code
- **Problem:** Duplicate `#[cfg(test)]` MIME/security helpers can report safer behavior than the actual `ruff serve` runtime path.
- **Rule:** Keep static-server MIME and active-content fallback policy centralized in `src/serve_http.rs` and exercise it via production helper tests or subprocess integration tests.
- **Implication:** Do not maintain separate serve MIME policy logic in `src/main.rs` tests; it causes security drift and false confidence.

(Discovered during: 2026-05-06_22-32_v1-http-001-mime-policy-unification.md)

## Mental Model Summary

- Ruff favors explicit contracts and defensive compatibility over implicit inference.
- Parser behavior is token- and precedence-driven; contextual identifiers are intentional.
- Runtime builtin reliability depends on synchronized declaration/registration/dispatch/testing.
- VM/JIT work is highly stack- and CFG-sensitive; local edits often have global invariants.
- Do **not** assume performance refactors are safe unless benchmark/output contracts are explicitly preserved.
