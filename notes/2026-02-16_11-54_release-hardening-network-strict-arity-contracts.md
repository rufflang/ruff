# Ruff Field Notes — Network strict-arity hardening follow-through

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Session:** 11:54 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 2d0294f
**Scope:** Implemented v0.10.0 P1 release-hardening strict-arity enforcement for declared TCP/UDP native APIs. Added comprehensive extra-argument rejection contracts, validated with targeted and full-suite test runs, and synchronized changelog/roadmap/readme.

---

## What I Changed
- Hardened network native dispatch argument contracts in `src/interpreter/native_functions/network.rs`:
  - enforced explicit arity for `tcp_listen`, `tcp_accept`, `tcp_connect`, `tcp_send`, `tcp_receive`, `tcp_close`, `tcp_set_nonblocking`
  - enforced explicit arity for `udp_bind`, `udp_send_to`, `udp_receive_from`, `udp_close`
- Added comprehensive strict-arity release-hardening test coverage in `src/interpreter/native_functions/mod.rs`:
  - new test: `test_release_hardening_network_module_strict_arity_contracts`
  - verifies extra-argument rejection for every declared TCP/UDP entry point
- Updated release documentation:
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `README.md`
- Preserved atomic commit boundaries:
  - runtime behavior commit
  - tests commit
  - docs commit

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Positional argument matching alone still allows trailing arguments
  - **Symptom:** APIs matched required positions but accepted unexpected trailing arguments silently.
  - **Root cause:** Patterns like `arg_values.first()` + `arg_values.get(1)` do not enforce strict arity by themselves.
  - **Fix:** Add explicit `arg_values.len() == N` (or exact bounded arity rule) before positional matching.
  - **Prevention:** For release-hardening slices, always add both missing-argument and extra-argument contract tests for each public entry point.

- **Gotcha:** `cargo fmt` produced unrelated churn in large native-function files during a focused slice
  - **Symptom:** `git status --short` showed formatting edits in unrelated modules after formatter run.
  - **Root cause:** Workspace formatting spillover touched neighboring test/module code.
  - **Fix:** Reverted unrelated files with `git checkout -- <files>` and re-applied only intended changes.
  - **Prevention:** Always re-scope the working tree after formatting before staging commits.

## Things I Learned
- Strict-arity hardening is an explicit contract layer, not an automatic consequence of positional type checks.
- The release-hardening pattern for public builtins should be: dispatch coverage -> argument/error shape tests -> strict-arity tests -> behavior tests.
- Keeping behavior, tests, and docs in separate commits made it easier to recover from formatter spillover without losing intended code changes.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** No persistent failing test; targeted network contracts passed after implementation. Temporary issue was unrelated formatter churn in working tree.
- **Repro steps:** Run `cargo fmt`, then inspect `git status --short` during a focused network-slice edit.
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** Used `git status --short` and targeted `cargo test release_hardening_network_module` runs to isolate intended diffs.
- **Final diagnosis:** Behavior changes were correct; noise came from formatter spillover, not runtime logic or test regressions.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Continue v0.10 release-hardening follow-through by selecting the next newly introduced/modified public builtin slice and adding strict-arity + contract parity coverage where missing.
- [ ] Consider lightweight helper patterns/macros for repetitive strict-arity guard logic in native modules to reduce drift risk.
