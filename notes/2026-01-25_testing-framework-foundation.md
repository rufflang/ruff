# Testing Framework Foundation - Session Notes
**Date**: 2026-01-25  
**Feature**: Built-in Testing Framework (ROADMAP #27) - Foundation Work  
**Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Syntax and Assertions Complete, Test Runner Pending  
**Commits**: 3 incremental commits  
**Files Changed**: src/lexer.rs, src/ast.rs, src/parser.rs, src/interpreter.rs, src/compiler.rs, src/type_checker.rs, tests/

---

## Summary

Implemented the foundational infrastructure for Ruff's built-in testing framework. Added complete syntax support for test declarations and implemented assertion functions. This provides the groundwork for a full testing system, though the test runner and CLI integration remain to be completed.

**Key Achievement**: Test syntax is now part of the language grammar and assertion functions are fully functional built-ins.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Test Syntax Support ✅

**Lexer Extensions** (src/lexer.rs):
- Added keywords: `test`, `test_setup`, `test_teardown`, `test_group`
- Updated keyword list and documentation

**AST Extensions** (src/ast.rs):
- `Stmt::Test { name: String, body: Vec<Stmt> }`
- `Stmt::TestSetup { body: Vec<Stmt> }`
- `Stmt::TestTeardown { body: Vec<Stmt> }`
- `Stmt::TestGroup { name: String, tests: Vec<Stmt> }`

**Parser Extensions** (src/parser.rs):
- `parse_test()` - parses `test "name" { body }`
- `parse_test_setup()` - parses `test_setup { body }`
- `parse_test_teardown()` - parses `test_teardown { body }`
- `parse_test_group()` - parses `test_group "name" { tests }`

**Integration**:
- Compiler: Test statements treated as no-ops during bytecode compilation
- Interpreter: Test statements no-op in normal execution (reserved for test mode)
- Type Checker: Test bodies type-checked in isolated scopes

### 2. Assertion Functions ✅

Implemented 4 core assertion functions as native built-ins:

**`assert_equal(actual, expected)`**:
- Compares two values for equality
- Returns `Bool(true)` on success
- Returns `Error` with detailed message on failure
- Uses `values_equal()` for proper comparison

**`assert_true(value)`**:
- Asserts value is boolean true
- Returns `Bool(true)` on success
- Returns `Error("Assertion failed: expected true, got false")` on failure

**`assert_false(value)`**:
- Asserts value is boolean false
- Returns `Bool(true)` on success
- Returns `Error("Assertion failed: expected false, got true")` on failure

**`assert_contains(collection, item)`**:
- Works with arrays, strings, and dicts
- Array: checks if item exists using `values_equal()`
- String: checks if substring exists
- Dict: checks if key exists
- Returns detailed error messages showing what was searched

---

## Example Syntax

```ruff
# Basic test
test "addition works" {
    result := 2 + 2
    assert_equal(result, 4)
}

# Test with setup/teardown
test_setup {
    db := db_connect("sqlite", ":memory:")
    db_execute(db, "CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name TEXT)", [])
}

test "can insert user" {
    db_execute(db, "INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')", [])
    rows := db_query(db, "SELECT * FROM users", [])
    assert_equal(len(rows), 1)
}

test_teardown {
    db_close(db)
}

# Test groups
test_group "array operations" {
    test "push works" {
        arr := [1, 2, 3]
        result := push(arr, 4)
        assert_contains(result, 4)
    }
    
    test "pop works" {
        arr := [1, 2, 3]
        result := pop(arr)
        assert_equal(result, 3)
    }
}
```

## What Remains To Be Done

### 1. Test Runner Implementation (High Priority)

**Required Functionality**:
- Collect all `Test`, `TestSetup`, `TestTeardown`, `TestGroup` statements from parsed AST
- Execute in correct order: setup → test → teardown for each test
- Catch assertion failures (Error values) and record as test failures
- Track test results: pass/fail/error counts
- Generate summary report
- Handle nested test groups
- Support test filtering by name/pattern

**Design Approach**:
```rust
pub struct TestRunner {
    setup: Option<Vec<Stmt>>,
    teardown: Option<Vec<Stmt>>,
    tests: Vec<(String, Vec<Stmt>)>,
    results: Vec<TestResult>,
}

pub struct TestResult {
    name: String,
    status: TestStatus,  // Pass, Fail, Error
    message: Option<String>,
    duration: Duration,
}

impl TestRunner {
    pub fn collect_tests(&mut self, stmts: &[Stmt]);
    pub fn run_all(&mut self, interp: &mut Interpreter) -> TestReport;
    fn run_single_test(&mut self, name: &str, body: &[Stmt], interp: &mut Interpreter) -> TestResult;
}
```

### 2. CLI Integration (High Priority)

**New Command**:
```bash
ruff test file.ruff              # Run all tests in file
ruff test file.ruff --verbose    # Show each assertion
ruff test file.ruff --filter "array*"  # Run tests matching pattern
ruff test tests/                 # Run all tests in directory
```

**Implementation** (src/main.rs):
- Add new `Commands::TestRun` variant
- Parse test file(s)
- Create `TestRunner` instance
- Collect and execute tests
- Print results with colors (green/red)
- Exit with code 0 (all pass) or 1 (any fail)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

**Current Issue**: Assertions return `Error` values, but these don't automatically propagate or stop execution.

**Needed**:
- Test runner should detect Error return values from assertions
- Convert Error values to test failures automatically
- Assertions should work naturally without try/except wrapping

**Option 1**: Make assertions throw errors that propagate
**Option 2**: Test runner intercepts Error values after each statement

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Create** `tests/testing_framework.ruff`:
- 15-20 test cases covering:
  - Basic assertions (equal, true, false, contains)
  - Test setup and teardown
  - Test groups
  - Nested tests
  - Edge cases (empty arrays, null values, error messages)
  - Multiple assertions per test
  - Test isolation (no state leakage)

### 5. Example File

**Create** `examples/testing_demo.ruff`:
- Real-world testing scenarios
- Best practices demonstration
- HTTP endpoint testing
- Database testing
- String manipulation testing
- Array/dict operation testing

### 6. Documentation Updates

**CHANGELOG.md**:
- Full API documentation for all 4 assertion functions
- Test syntax examples
- Usage guide for test runner
- Migration guide (if applicable)

**ROADMAP.md**:
- Mark testing framework as "In Progress" or partially complete
- Document what's done vs what remains
- Update estimated effort based on actual progress

**README.md**:
- New "Testing" section
- Show test syntax examples
- Link to testing_demo.ruff
- Explain how to run tests

---

## Technical Decisions & Gotchas

### 1. Test Statements Are Grammar-Level, Not Function Calls

**Decision**: Made `test`, `test_setup`, etc. keywords with dedicated AST nodes rather than special function calls.

**Why**: 
- Clearer syntax without confusion about function vs statement
- Better error messages from parser
- Easier to collect tests from AST
- Follows patterns from other languages (Rust's `#[test]`, Go's `func Test*`)

**Implication**: Test syntax is part of the language core, not a library.

### 2. Assertions Return Error Values, Don't Throw

**Decision**: Assertions return `Value::Error` on failure rather than using panic/exception mechanism.

**Why**:
- Consistent with Ruff's error handling model
- Allows test runner to intercept and handle failures
- Provides detailed error messages in return value

**Challenge**: Requires test runner to check every statement result for Error values. Normal execution doesn't automatically stop on Error return.

### 3. Test Statements No-Op in Normal Execution

**Decision**: When running a .ruff file normally (not in test mode), test statements do nothing.

**Why**:
- Allows test code to coexist with regular code
- Tests can import and test library functions in same file
- Syntax checking works without executing tests

**Implication**: Test mode must be explicitly activated (via CLI flag or test runner).

### 4. Compiler Warnings About Unused Fields

**Current**: `name` fields in `Stmt::Test` and `Stmt::TestGroup` generate dead_code warnings.

**Why**: Fields aren't used yet because test runner isn't implemented.

**Resolution**: Warnings will disappear once test runner accesses these fields for reporting.

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Partial Implementation Is Valid Progress

**Discovery**: Started with goal of complete testing framework (2-3 weeks), but ran out of time after foundational work.

**Lesson**: It's better to have solid foundations (syntax + assertions) than half-working everything. Future work can build on this cleanly.

**Implication**: Document partial implementations honestly in ROADMAP. Don't claim features are complete when they're not.

### 2. Error Propagation Needs Thought

**Discovery**: Assertions return Error values, but these don't automatically stop execution or propagate through call stacks.

**Lesson**: Ruff's error model (Error as value vs exception) requires explicit handling at each level. Test runner will need to check every statement result.

**Future**: Consider adding exception-style error propagation for better test framework UX.

### 3. Syntax-First Approach Works Well

**Discovery**: Implementing syntax (lexer/parser/AST) first, then semantics (execution), makes development smooth.

**Lesson**: Having valid syntax allows file parsing and syntax checking even without execution. Incremental development is easier.

**Pattern**: For future features, implement syntax first, commit, then add execution logic.

---

## Current Test Coverage

**What Works**:
- All test syntax parses correctly
- Type checker validates test bodies
- Assertion functions execute and return correct values
- Test files can be parsed and syntax-checked

**What Doesn't Work Yet**:
- Test runner doesn't exist - tests aren't collected or executed
- No CLI command for running tests
- Assertions don't automatically fail tests
- No test result reporting

## Conclusion

Successfully laid the foundation for Ruff's built-in testing framework. All syntax elements are in place and assertions work correctly. The remaining work (test runner and CLI) is well-scoped and can be completed in ~4 additional days of focused development.

This foundation enables immediate use of assertion functions in regular code, and the test syntax is validated and ready for the test runner implementation.
