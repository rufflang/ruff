# Ruff Field Notes — SSG Rayon In-Iterator Aggregation Reduction

**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Session:** 06:50 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / ded576a
**Scope:** Reduced residual SSG Rayon hot-path aggregation overhead by replacing per-file result buffering with in-iterator reduction and added regression coverage for partitioned aggregation correctness/failure surfacing.

---

## What I Changed
- Refactored `ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write(...)` in `src/interpreter/native_functions/async_ops.rs`:
  - removed intermediate `Vec<Result<(usize, u64, u64), String>>` collection
  - switched to Rayon `try_fold` + `try_reduce` to aggregate checksum and stage timings directly on the parallel iterator
- Preserved existing result/error contracts used by `ssg_read_render_and_write_pages(...)` callers:
  - output keys: `checksum`, `files`, `read_ms`, `render_write_ms`
  - read/write error message prefixes and index-context shape
- Added focused tests in `src/interpreter/native_functions/async_ops.rs`:
  - `test_ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write_partitioned_large_batch_checksum_matches_written_bytes`
  - `test_ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write_reports_error_when_any_partition_read_fails`
- Updated roadmap/changelog/readme milestone tracking:
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `README.md`

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Rayon `try_fold`/`try_reduce` closures can fail type inference for `Result` error types in this helper.
  - **Symptom:** Rust compile errors `E0282`/`E0283` around `Ok((...))` return values in the fold/reduce closures.
  - **Root cause:** The compiler cannot infer the `Result<T, E>` error type from closure context when multiple `From<_>` paths exist.
  - **Fix:** Use explicit return typing in closure results: `Ok::<(i64, u64, u64), String>((...))`.
  - **Prevention:** When introducing `try_*` iterator reducers in hot paths, annotate `Ok` type parameters early instead of waiting for inference.

- **Gotcha:** `cargo test` accepts one test-name filter token, not multiple test names in one command.
  - **Symptom:** `error: unexpected argument '...' found` when passing two test names after `cargo test`.
  - **Root cause:** Cargo command shape only allows one optional `[TESTNAME]` filter before `--` args.
  - **Fix:** Run tests separately, or use a shared substring filter that matches all intended tests.
  - **Prevention:** For targeted runs during fast iteration, prefer one filter per command to avoid command-shape failures.

## Things I Learned
- In this SSG helper, direct parallel reduction is a practical follow-through once contracts are stable; it removes transient per-file aggregation allocation without changing API shape.
- For throughput work in this repo, checksum equivalence tests are the safest correctness guardrail when changing internal scheduling/aggregation behavior.
- Large-batch partition tests are useful to validate reducer behavior that may not be exercised by small fixture counts.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:**
  - `error[E0282]: type annotations needed`
  - `cannot infer type of the type parameter E declared on the enum Result`
- **Repro steps:**
  - Introduce `try_fold`/`try_reduce` with untyped `Ok((...))` closures in `ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write(...)`
  - Run `cargo test test_ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write_checksum_matches_written_bytes`
- **Breakpoints / logs used:**
  - Rust compiler diagnostics around `src/interpreter/native_functions/async_ops.rs` closure return lines
- **Final diagnosis:**
  - Missing explicit `Result<_, String>` annotation in closure return values; fixed with `Ok::<..., String>(...)`.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Re-run `bench-ssg --runs` comparisons and capture wall-clock deltas attributable to in-iterator aggregation follow-through.
- [ ] Continue SSG throughput focus by profiling remaining hot spots after reduction and byte-path changes.
