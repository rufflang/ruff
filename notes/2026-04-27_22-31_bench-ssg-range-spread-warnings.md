# Ruff Field Notes - Bench SSG Range-Spread Warning Signals

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Session:** 22:31 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / a2d70b7
**Scope:** Added a new bench-ssg measurement-quality warning signal for min/max-to-median range spread and wired it through CLI threshold configuration, reporting, and regression coverage.

---

## What I Changed
- Added `SSG_RANGE_SPREAD_WARNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` and `range_spread_percent` to `SsgWarningThresholds` in `src/benchmarks/ssg.rs`.
- Added `SsgRunStatistics::range_spread_percent(...)` and `SsgRunStatistics::is_high_range_spread(...)`.
- Added `collect_ssg_range_spread_warnings_with_threshold(...)` plus warning-message formatting for range-spread diagnostics.
- Added `bench-ssg` CLI flag `--range-spread-warning-threshold <PERCENT>` in `src/main.rs`.
- Integrated range-spread warnings into measurement warning output and operator-hint output.
- Added regression tests for range-spread math, threshold behavior, warning header text, and warning hint text in `src/benchmarks/ssg.rs`.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Extending `SsgWarningThresholds` breaks tests in multiple places immediately.
  - **Symptom:** Compile errors for missing field initializers in warning-related tests.
  - **Root cause:** Tests instantiate `SsgWarningThresholds` directly instead of using `Default`.
  - **Fix:** Update every direct `SsgWarningThresholds { ... }` initializer with the new field.
  - **Prevention:** If a warning-threshold field is added, immediately grep for all `SsgWarningThresholds {` initializers and patch them in one pass.

## Things I Learned
- Existing measurement-quality warning UX is centralized around one header + one hint collector, so adding a new signal is clean if both are updated together.
- `cargo test ssg` is a high-signal fast loop for this area and catches both benchmark math regressions and CLI wiring compile issues.
- The warning system contract is now effectively four-part: CV, trend drift, mean/median drift, and range spread; keep docs synchronized whenever one changes.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** `error[E0063]: missing field 'range_spread_percent' in initializer of 'ssg::SsgWarningThresholds'`
- **Repro steps:** Run `cargo test ssg --quiet` after adding a new field to `SsgWarningThresholds`.
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** Rust compiler error output and targeted test reruns.
- **Final diagnosis:** Test fixtures were manually constructing `SsgWarningThresholds` without the new field.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Validate warning output readability on real noisy local runs with `ruff bench-ssg --runs 10 --warmup-runs 2`.
- [ ] If range warnings are noisy in CI, revisit default threshold calibration using stored benchmark history.
