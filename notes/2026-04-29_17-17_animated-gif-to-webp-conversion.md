# Ruff Field Notes — Animated GIF to WebP Conversion

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Session:** 17:17 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 1a8e776
**Scope:** Added a dedicated `gif_to_webp(...)` native function to preserve animation when converting GIF to WebP, with controllable quality/compression settings and strict argument validation.

---

## What I Changed
- Added `gif_to_webp` native function in `src/interpreter/native_functions/filesystem.rs`.
  - Signature: `gif_to_webp(input_path, output_path[, quality[, method[, lossless]]])`
  - Uses external `gif2webp` CLI backend to preserve animated frames.
  - Validates quality range (0-100), method range (0-6), type checks, and missing input file.
  - Returns `Value::Bool(true)` on success; returns descriptive `Value::Error(...)` on failures.
- Registered builtin in `src/interpreter/mod.rs`:
  - Added to `Interpreter::get_builtin_names()`.
  - Added to `register_builtins()` environment definitions.
- Added type checker signature in `src/type_checker.rs`.
- Added release-hardening dispatch/contract tests in `src/interpreter/native_functions/mod.rs`:
  - New test: `test_release_hardening_gif_to_webp_dispatch_contracts`.
  - Added `gif_to_webp` to dispatch coverage list.
- Updated usage docs in `examples/image_processing.ruff` with an animated GIF -> animated WebP example.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** `load_image(...)` + `img.save(...)` cannot preserve GIF animation because it works with `DynamicImage` (single image value model).
  - **Symptom:** Converting animated GIF via image-value methods flattens to a still frame.
  - **Root cause:** Ruff image value stores a single `DynamicImage`; there is no multi-frame timeline in `Value::Image`.
  - **Fix:** Added `gif_to_webp(...)` path that delegates to `gif2webp`, which preserves animation.
  - **Prevention:** Treat animated media conversion as a separate API path from single-image transforms unless `Value::Image` gains frame-sequence semantics.

- **Gotcha:** High-quality animated conversion relies on external tooling availability.
  - **Symptom:** Conversion fails even with valid args if `gif2webp` binary is missing.
  - **Root cause:** Animated WebP encoding is delegated to the `gif2webp` command.
  - **Fix:** Added explicit NotFound error message: install `gif2webp` and ensure it is in `PATH`.
  - **Prevention:** Check `command -v gif2webp` in setup/CI when animated conversions are required.

## Things I Learned
- Ruff’s current in-memory image API is optimized for still images, not frame-based animation pipelines.
- For animated GIF -> WebP quality control, `gif2webp` gives practical knobs (`-q`, `-m`, lossy/lossless) without redesigning image value types.
- For user-facing quality guarantees, strict argument contracts and clear runtime diagnostics matter as much as conversion support itself.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** N/A (new functionality added with contract tests; no failing regression tests encountered).
- **Repro steps:**
  - Contract test: `cargo test test_release_hardening_gif_to_webp_dispatch_contracts -- --nocapture`
  - Dispatch coverage: `cargo test test_release_hardening_builtin_dispatch_coverage_for_recent_apis -- --nocapture`
  - Tool availability: `command -v gif2webp`
- **Breakpoints / logs used:**
  - Traced native dispatch flow in `src/interpreter/native_functions/mod.rs` and filesystem handlers in `src/interpreter/native_functions/filesystem.rs`.
- **Final diagnosis:**
  - Existing image method path is single-frame only; animated conversion required a dedicated function and backend.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Add an optional integration test that executes real animated GIF -> WebP conversion when `gif2webp` is present in CI/local environment.
- [ ] Consider first-class animated image value support if future API needs frame-level transforms in Ruff scripts.
