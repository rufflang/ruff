# Bytecode Compiler & VM - Implementation Completion Session

**Date**: 2026-01-25  
**Time**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: ✅ Core Implementation Complete (with known limitations)  
**Feature**: Bytecode Compiler & VM (ROADMAP #21, P1) - Completion Session

---

## Summary

Completed the core implementation of the Bytecode Compiler & VM feature for Ruff. The VM is now functional for basic programs with user-defined functions, arithmetic, control flow, and arrays. Discovered and documented a parser issue with built-in function calls that needs separate attention.

**What was completed:**
- Fixed function call parameter binding (proper argument-to-parameter mapping)
- Fixed array spread operations with marker-based collection
- Added CLI `--vm` flag for toggling bytecode execution
- Integrated VM with main.rs execution path
- Added basic native function support (print, len, to_string)
- Updated CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, and README documentation
- Created test files demonstrating VM capabilities
- All code compiles without warnings or errors

**What still needs work:**
- Parser issue: Built-in function calls sometimes parsed as arrays instead of Call expressions
- Comprehensive native function integration (only 3 functions currently supported)
- Benchmark suite to measure actual speedup
- Test suite for VM operations
- Advanced optimizations

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Function Call Parameter Binding (COMPLETED ✅)

**Problem**: VM's `call_function` method had TODO for parameter binding. Arguments weren't being bound to parameter names in the function's local environment.

**Solution**:
- Added `params` field to `BytecodeChunk` to store parameter names
- Updated compiler to set `chunk.params` when compiling functions
- Modified VM's `call_function` to:
  - Check argument count matches parameter count
  - Bind each argument to its corresponding parameter name
  - Store bindings in the call frame's `locals` HashMap
  - Add captured variables from closures

**Testing**: User-defined functions now work correctly with multiple parameters.

### 2. Array Spread Operations (COMPLETED ✅)

**Problem**: `MakeArray` opcode couldn't handle dynamic element counts from spread operations. SpreadArray pushes variable numbers of elements onto the stack.

**Solution**:
- Added `Value::ArrayMarker` variant to mark array boundaries
- Added `PushArrayMarker` opcode to push markers
- Compiler emits marker before array elements if spreads present
- `MakeArray` collects elements until it hits the marker (or count elements if no marker)
- Updated all Value match statements to handle ArrayMarker

**Code Changes**:
```rust
// In interpreter.rs Value enum
Value::ArrayMarker, // Internal marker for dynamic array construction

// In compiler.rs
if has_spread {
    self.chunk.emit(OpCode::PushArrayMarker);
}
// ... compile elements ...
self.chunk.emit(OpCode::MakeArray(elements.len()));

// In vm.rs
OpCode::MakeArray(count) => {
    // Collect elements, stopping early if marker found
    for _ in 0..count {
        let value = self.stack.pop()?;
        if matches!(value, Value::ArrayMarker) {
            break;
        }
        elements.push(value);
    }
    // ...
}
```

### 3. CLI Integration (COMPLETED ✅)

**Changes to main.rs**:
- Added `vm: bool` flag to `Run` command
- Created VM execution branch that:
  - Compiles AST to bytecode with `Compiler::compile()`
  - Creates VM instance and sets up global environment
  - Registers all built-in functions as `NativeFunction` values
  - Executes bytecode with `VM::execute()`
  - Reports compilation or runtime errors

**Usage**:
```bash
ruff run script.ruff --vm  # Use bytecode VM
ruff run script.ruff       # Use tree-walking interpreter (default)
```

### 4. Native Function Support (PARTIAL ✅)

**Implemented Functions**:
- `print(...)` - Prints values with spaces between arguments
- `len(array/string/dict)` - Returns length
- `to_string(value)` - Converts value to string

**Helper Method**:
- `VM::value_to_string()` - Formats values for printing and string conversion

**Limitations**: Only 3 functions implemented. Full integration with interpreter's 100+ built-ins requires more work.

### 5. Documentation Updates (COMPLETED ✅)

**CHANGELOG.md**:
- Updated bytecode VM entry with current status
- Noted known limitations (parser issue, incomplete native functions)
- Documented what works and what needs work

**ROADMAP.md**:
- Updated status to "Partial Implementation - Core complete"
- Listed completed tasks (✅) vs remaining tasks (⏳)
- Reorganized remaining work by priority
- Added new section on parser fix needed

**README.md**:
- Added "Bytecode VM (Experimental)" section after "Getting Started"
- Documented `--vm` flag usage
- Listed current capabilities and limitations
- Set expectations about experimental nature

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Built-in Function Parsing Issue (HIGH PRIORITY 🔴)

**Problem**: `print("hello")` compiles to MakeArray instead of Call opcode.

**Evidence**:
```
DEBUG: Constants: [String("Hello from VM!"), String("print"), Int(42)]
DEBUG: IP=0, Instruction=LoadConst(0), Stack size=0
DEBUG: IP=1, Instruction=LoadConst(1), Stack size=1  # "print" as string
DEBUG: IP=2, Instruction=MakeArray(2), Stack size=2   # ❌ Should be Call(1)
```

**Analysis**:
- User-defined functions work correctly and emit `Call` opcodes
- Only built-in function names trigger this behavior
- Parser likely has special handling for built-ins that conflicts with compiler expectations
- The regular interpreter works fine, so this is VM-specific compilation issue

**Workaround**: Use user-defined functions instead of built-ins for now.

**Next Steps**: Debug parser's function call recognition for built-in names.

### 2. Limited Native Function Support

Only 3 built-in functions implemented. The interpreter has 100+ built-ins that need VM integration:
- Math functions (abs, sqrt, sin, cos, etc.)
- String manipulation (split, join, replace, etc.)
- Array operations (map, filter, reduce, etc.)
- File I/O (read_file, write_file, etc.)
- HTTP operations (http_get, http_post, etc.)
- And many more...

**Solution**: Create comprehensive native function bridge between VM and interpreter's built-in registry.

### 3. No Performance Benchmarks

We haven't measured actual speedup yet. Need:
- Benchmark suite (fibonacci, sorting, nested loops)
- Timing comparison between VM and tree-walking interpreter
- Validation of 10-20x speedup goal

---

## Testing Results

**Test Files Created**:
```
examples/vm_ultra_simple.ruff      - Variable assignment (✅ works)
examples/vm_func_test.ruff         - User functions (✅ works)
examples/vm_userprint_test.ruff    - Custom function calls (✅ works)
examples/vm_print_correct.ruff     - Built-in print (❌ parser issue)
examples/vm_print_onearg.ruff      - Built-in with arg (❌ parser issue)
examples/vm_print_noargs.ruff      - Built-in no args (✅ works but no output)
examples/vm_test_simple.ruff       - Original test (❌ parser issue)
```

**Successful Tests**:
- ✅ Variable assignment and storage
- ✅ Arithmetic operations
- ✅ User-defined function definitions
- ✅ User-defined function calls with parameters
- ✅ Recursive functions (factorial tested)

**Failed Tests** (due to parser issue):
- ❌ Built-in function calls with arguments
- ❌ Print statements with values

**Partial Success**:
- ⚠️ Built-in functions with no arguments work but produce no observable effect

## Architecture Insights

### Why Stack-Based VM?

**Decision**: Chose stack-based architecture over register-based.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler to implement and debug
- Natural fit for expression evaluation
- Proven design (Python, JVM, Lua all use stacks)
- Can optimize to registers later if needed

**Trade-offs**:
- More instructions needed (push/pop overhead)
- Register-based VMs can be faster for some workloads
- But stack-based is fast enough for 10-20x goal

### Call Frame Design

**Structure**:
```rust
struct CallFrame {
    return_ip: usize,          // Where to resume after return
    stack_offset: usize,       // Stack position before call
    locals: HashMap<String, Value>, // Local variables
    prev_chunk: Option<BytecodeChunk>, // Previous code chunk
}
```

**Why this works**:
- Clean separation between call frames
- Each function gets isolated locals
- Stack management automatic via offset
- Can nest function calls arbitrarily deep

### Marker-Based Array Construction

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
1. **Track spread element count dynamically** - Complex, requires runtime counting
2. **Restructure how array construction works** - Too invasive
3. **Special opcode for dynamic arrays** - Adds complexity
4. **Marker-based collection** - ✅ Chosen for simplicity and elegance

**Why markers work well**:
- Simple to implement
- Clear semantics (collect until marker)
- No runtime element counting needed
- Works naturally with spread expansion

---

## Gotchas & Sharp Edges

### 1. Built-in Function Names as Strings

**Surprise**: When `print("hello")` compiles, constant pool contains `String("print")` instead of a function reference.

**Lesson**: Parser treats certain identifiers specially. Need to investigate how built-in names are tokenized and parsed.

**Impact**: Can't use built-in functions from VM until parser issue resolved.

### 2. Compile-time vs Runtime Constant Types

**Observation**: `Constant` enum in bytecode.rs has `Function` variant for compiled functions, but natives are stored as `NativeFunction` string names in the Value enum.

**Why**: Functions can be compiled to bytecode at compile time. Natives exist only at runtime in the interpreter's registry.

**Implication**: Native functions need dynamic lookup during execution. This is correct but different from user functions.

### 3. Stack Underflow Debug Technique

**Problem**: "Stack underflow" errors were cryptic without context.

**Solution**: Added debug output showing:
- Current instruction pointer
- Current instruction being executed
- Stack size before execution

**Result**: Immediately identified that MakeArray was being called instead of Call for built-in functions.

**Lesson**: Strategic debug output is invaluable for VM development. Consider keeping optional debug mode.

## Performance Expectations

**Current Performance**: Unknown (no benchmarks yet)

**Goal**: 10-20x faster than tree-walking interpreter

**Theory**:
- Tree-walking: ~50-100x slower than native code
- Bytecode VM: ~5-10x slower than native code
- Therefore: 10-20x improvement expected

**Why not faster?**:
- Still interpreting bytecode (not JIT compiled)
- Value enum overhead (heap-allocated, boxed)
- No advanced optimizations yet

**Future Optimizations** (not implemented):
- Constant folding at compile time
- Dead code elimination
- Inline caching for method calls
- JIT compilation to native code (LLVM backend)
- Escape analysis for stack allocation

---

## Code Quality

**Compilation Status**: ✅ Compiles cleanly with no warnings

**Test Coverage**: Limited - only manual testing with example files

**Code Organization**:
- `bytecode.rs` - OpCode definitions and BytecodeChunk structure
- `compiler.rs` - AST to bytecode compilation
- `vm.rs` - Virtual machine execution engine
- `main.rs` - CLI integration
- `interpreter.rs` - Value enum shared between VM and interpreter

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Incremental Development**: Fixed one issue at a time (parameter binding, then spreads, then CLI)

2. **Test-Driven Debug**: Created minimal test files to isolate problems instead of debugging complex programs

3. **Marker Pattern**: The marker-based array collection was elegant and simple

4. **Documentation First**: Updated docs immediately while details were fresh

5. **Clean Commits**: Each commit represented one logical change with clear message

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Parser Understanding**: Should have investigated parser behavior earlier before assuming built-in functions would "just work"

2. **Test Suite**: Should create comprehensive automated tests instead of manual examples

3. **Benchmarking**: Would be good to measure performance early to validate approach

### For Next Session

1. **Fix Parser Issue**: Debug why `print("hello")` parses differently than `my_func("hello")`

2. **Native Function Bridge**: Create systematic way to call interpreter built-ins from VM

3. **Automated Tests**: Create test suite in tests/ directory

4. **Benchmark**: Measure actual VM performance vs interpreter

5. **Document Findings**: Update notes with parser investigation results

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented the core bytecode compiler and VM architecture for Ruff. The VM is functional for basic programs and demonstrates that the approach is sound. Discovered a parser issue with built-in functions that needs attention, but this doesn't block further VM development. The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase: fixing the parser, adding comprehensive native function support, and measuring actual performance improvements.

**Key Achievement**: Ruff now has two execution engines (tree-walking and bytecode VM), allowing for performance optimization without changing the language semantics.

**Recommendation**: Focus next session on fixing the parser issue to unlock full VM functionality, then add benchmarks to validate the performance improvements.
