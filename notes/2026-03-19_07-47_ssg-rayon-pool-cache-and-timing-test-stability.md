# Ruff Field Notes — Cached Rayon pool reuse + timing test stability

**Date:** 2026-03-19
**Session:** 07:47 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 152e375
**Scope:** Implemented the next high-priority v0.11 SSG throughput follow-through by caching/reusing CPU-bounded Rayon pools in `ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write(...)`, then stabilized a flaky full-suite timing regression test while preserving behavior contracts.

---

## What I Changed
- Added reusable Rayon pool cache in `src/interpreter/native_functions/async_ops.rs`:
  - `SSG_RAYON_POOL_CACHE: OnceLock<Mutex<HashMap<usize, Arc<rayon::ThreadPool>>>>`
  - `ssg_rayon_pool_cache()` helper
  - `ssg_get_or_create_rayon_pool(rayon_threads)` helper
- Switched `ssg_run_rayon_read_render_write(...)` from per-call `ThreadPoolBuilder::new().build()` to cached-pool retrieval.
- Added regression tests in `src/interpreter/native_functions/async_ops.rs`:
  - `test_ssg_get_or_create_rayon_pool_reuses_existing_pool_for_same_size`
  - `test_ssg_get_or_create_rayon_pool_distinguishes_thread_counts`
  - `test_ssg_run_rayon_cached_pool_repeated_calls_preserve_checksum_contract`
- Updated user-facing/project docs:
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `README.md`
- Stabilized flaky full-suite contract test:
  - Updated `test_ssg_run_rayon_single_pass_cumulative_timing_grows_with_file_count` to assert deterministic correctness growth (`checksum_n > checksum_1`) and non-negative stage metrics rather than assuming timing monotonicity across run sizes.

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Full-suite timing monotonicity assumptions are flaky for cumulative stage metrics.
  - **Symptom:** Full `cargo test` failed intermittently with:
    - `cumulative read_ms for 16 files (2.018239) must be >= 1 file (2.339628)`
  - **Root cause:** `read_ms`/`render_write_ms` are measured durations affected by OS scheduling and cache state; they are not deterministic monotonic proof-of-work signals between test runs.
  - **Fix:** Replace monotonic timing assertion with deterministic correctness assertion (`checksum_n > checksum_1`) and keep explicit non-negative timing checks.
  - **Prevention:** In SSG throughput tests, use checksum/file-count/output-content contracts as primary deterministic gates; treat timing metrics as informational/non-negative only.

- **Gotcha:** Cached pool creation must use a double-check pattern around lock boundaries.
  - **Symptom:** Naive lock-once implementation can hold the cache lock while pool build occurs or race duplicate creation under contention.
  - **Root cause:** Building a Rayon `ThreadPool` while holding cache lock unnecessarily broadens critical section; unlocking before build introduces TOCTOU unless re-checked.
  - **Fix:** Check cache under lock → unlock and build → re-lock and check again before insert.
  - **Prevention:** Keep expensive pool construction outside mutex guard and always perform second existence check before inserting.

## Things I Learned
- CPU-bounded pool sizing (`min(concurrency_limit, available_parallelism).max(1)`) plus pool reuse avoids both over-subscription and repeated pool-build overhead.
- For SSG pipeline tests, deterministic invariants are checksum/file-count/output mapping; timing values are contractually useful but not stable enough for monotonic ordering assertions.
- Session-note capture should include “justified behavior” moments explicitly (e.g., why non-monotonic timing is expected and safe).

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** `interpreter::native_functions::async_ops::tests::test_ssg_run_rayon_single_pass_cumulative_timing_grows_with_file_count` failed during full-suite run with panic:
  - `cumulative read_ms for 16 files (2.018239) must be >= 1 file (2.339628)`
- **Repro steps:**
  - `cargo build && cargo test`
- **Breakpoints / logs used:**
  - Examined full test output and reran targeted SSG tests after patching assertion logic.
- **Final diagnosis:**
  - Test encoded an invalid determinism assumption for stage timing ordering; behavior and output contracts were still correct.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Run `ruff bench-ssg --runs 7 --profile-async` on an idle machine and compare before/after median build time impact of cached pool reuse.
- [ ] Consider applying the same pool-cache pattern to other repeated Rayon hot paths (for example `parallel_map` fast lane) if profile data shows pool build overhead is material there.
