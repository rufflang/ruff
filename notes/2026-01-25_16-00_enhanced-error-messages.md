# Ruff Field Notes — Enhanced Error Messages Implementation

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Session:** 16:00 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / 80f68a8
**Scope:** Implemented enhanced error messages with Levenshtein distance "Did you mean?" suggestions, helpful context, and multiple error reporting for better developer experience (ROADMAP v0.8.0 P1 feature #20)

---

## What I Changed

- **src/errors.rs**:
  - Added `suggestion`, `help`, and `note` fields to `RuffError` struct
  - Implemented `with_suggestion()`, `with_help()`, and `with_note()` builder methods
  - Enhanced `Display` implementation to show help/suggestion/note sections with color coding
  - Implemented `levenshtein_distance()` function for string similarity comparison
  - Implemented `find_closest_match()` to find best suggestion from candidate list (max distance: 3)

- **src/type_checker.rs**:
  - Added `get_available_variables()` and `get_available_functions()` helper methods
  - Enhanced all type mismatch errors with `.with_help()` providing actionable guidance
  - Enhanced undefined function errors with `.with_suggestion()` using Levenshtein distance
  - Added contextual `.with_note()` messages explaining why errors occurred
  - Updated 6 different error creation sites: variable type mismatch, const type mismatch, return type mismatch, assignment type mismatch, comparison type mismatch, undefined function

- **tests/**:
  - Created `tests/simple_error_test.ruff` - minimal test demonstrating enhanced errors
  - Created `tests/enhanced_errors.ruff` - comprehensive 15-test suite (though some tests are documentation-focused)

- **Documentation**:
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed feature description and examples
  - Updated `ROADMAP.md` marking feature #20 as complete
  - Updated `README.md` showcasing enhanced error messages with example output

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)

- **Gotcha:** String literals cannot be passed directly to methods expecting `String`
  - **Symptom:** Compiler errors: `expected String, found &str` when calling `.with_help("message")`
  - **Root cause:** Rust's type system distinguishes between `&str` (string slices) and `String` (owned strings)
  - **Fix:** Add `.to_string()` to all string literal arguments: `.with_help("message".to_string())`
  - **Prevention:** When adding new builder methods that take strings, remember to convert literals with `.to_string()`

- **Gotcha:** Token struct already had line/column tracking
  - **Symptom:** Initially planned to add location tracking, but found it already existed
  - **Root cause:** Previous work had already added line/column fields to Token struct
  - **Fix:** None needed - leveraged existing infrastructure
  - **Prevention:** Always search for existing infrastructure before implementing new features. Use `grep_search` to find similar code.

- **Gotcha:** Type checker already implements multiple error reporting
  - **Symptom:** Planned to add multiple error collection, but it already existed
  - **Root cause:** Type checker uses `errors: Vec<RuffError>` and returns `Err(self.errors.clone())`
  - **Fix:** None needed - feature already worked as expected
  - **Prevention:** Review existing code structure before implementation. The `check()` method signature returning `Result<(), Vec<RuffError>>` was a clue.

- **Gotcha:** Compiler warning about `get_available_variables` being unused is expected
  - **Symptom:** Warning during compilation about unused method
  - **Root cause:** Method added for future use when adding "Did you mean?" suggestions to interpreter (currently only in type checker)
  - **Fix:** None - this is expected temporary warning
  - **Prevention:** This is intentional scaffolding. The method will be used when enhancing interpreter error messages in future work.

## Things I Learned

- **Levenshtein distance threshold of 3 is appropriate** for "Did you mean?" suggestions
  - Catches common typos (missing/extra character, transposition)
  - Avoids suggesting completely unrelated names
  - Tested with: `calculat_sum` → `calculate_sum` (distance: 1), `proces_data` → `process_data` (distance: 1)

- **Error display uses builder pattern effectively** for optional fields
  - `RuffError::new().with_help().with_note().with_suggestion()` chains cleanly
  - Each method returns `Self` for chaining
  - Optional fields use `Option<String>` and only display if `Some`

- **Type checker has good separation of concerns**
  - Collects errors without stopping execution
  - Single `check()` method returns all errors at once
  - Each error type has specific handling in different parts of `infer_expr()` and `check_stmt()`

- **Colored output is handled by the `colored` crate**
  - `.red().bold()` for error markers
  - `.bright_blue()` for location info
  - `.bright_yellow()` for help messages
  - `.bright_green()` for suggestions
  - `.bright_cyan()` for notes

- **Error context sections have consistent formatting**
  - Help: `= help: <message>`
  - Suggestion: `= Did you mean '<name>'?`
  - Note: `= note: <message>`
  - All prefixed with `=` symbol for visual consistency

## Debug Notes

- **Issue:** Tests take longer than expected to run
  - **Repro steps:** Run `./target/debug/ruff run tests/enhanced_errors.ruff`
  - **Diagnosis:** Test file includes many type errors that trigger type checker, but some tests use runtime constructs. Type errors don't prevent runtime execution in current implementation.
  - **Resolution:** Created simpler `tests/simple_error_test.ruff` for quick verification

- **Output verification:** Enhanced error messages display correctly
  ```
  Type Error: Type mismatch: variable 'x' declared as Int but assigned String
    --> 0:0
     = help: Try removing the type annotation or converting the value to the correct type

  Undefined Function: Undefined function 'calculat_sum'
    --> 0:0
     = Did you mean 'calculate_sum'?
     = note: Function must be defined before it is called
  ```
  - Note: Line/column shows as 0:0 because AST nodes don't yet propagate source locations, only Tokens have them. This is acceptable for v0.8.0; full location tracking through AST would be a future enhancement.

---

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)

- [ ] Propagate source locations from Tokens through AST nodes for accurate line:column display in errors (currently shows 0:0)
- [ ] Add "Did you mean?" suggestions to interpreter runtime errors (not just type checker)
- [ ] Consider adding error codes (e.g., E001, E002) for searchable documentation
- [ ] Potentially add "see also" references to documentation when suggesting fixes
- [ ] Clean up `tests/enhanced_errors.ruff` - some tests are more documentation than runnable tests
