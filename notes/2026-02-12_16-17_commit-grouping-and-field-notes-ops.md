# Ruff Field Notes — Commit grouping and field-notes ops

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Session:** 16:17 local
**Branch/Commit:** main / f974f43
**Scope:** Grouped a large remaining formatting-heavy working tree into logical commits by subsystem, then verified clean history and push status. Applied the field-notes workflow by recording concrete operational rules discovered during the session.

---

## What I Changed
- Split remaining uncommitted changes into focused commits instead of one mixed commit.
- Created grouped commits for:
  - benchmark/examples formatting
  - interpreter runtime/native-function formatting
  - JIT formatting
  - CLI/error/tests formatting
- Verified clean status and recent log with `git status --short` and `git --no-pager log --oneline -n 6`.
- Confirmed push completed successfully.
- Updated operational memory artifacts:
  - `notes/GOTCHAS.md`
  - `notes/README.md`

## Gotchas (Read This Next Time)
- **Gotcha:** Large format-only diffs can accidentally become review-hostile if committed as one batch.
  - **Symptom:** One working tree touched many subsystems (`src/jit.rs`, `src/interpreter/*`, `src/benchmarks/*`, `tests/*`, `examples/*`) with mostly reflow/import-order noise.
  - **Root cause:** Formatting churn was generated across unrelated domains before commit boundaries were defined.
  - **Fix:** Group commits by subsystem ownership and review intent, then commit each group separately.
  - **Prevention:** Before first `git add`, run `git status --short`, classify files into subsystem buckets, and stage with explicit file lists.

- **Gotcha:** Progress can look “done” while no scope isolation has actually happened yet.
  - **Symptom:** Planning/TODO state existed, but history remained unstructured until real staged commits were made.
  - **Root cause:** Planning artifacts do not change repository state.
  - **Fix:** Treat inventory + first grouped commit as the true start of completion.
  - **Prevention:** Use a hard checkpoint: no task considered “in progress” until at least one scoped commit exists.

## Things I Learned
- For wide formatting churn, the safest sequence is: inventory → grouping map → small explicit staging lists → commit per subsystem.
- JIT-heavy repos need their own commit for readability; `src/jit.rs` dominates diffs and obscures smaller changes if mixed.
- Rule: always validate end-state with both clean status and short log to ensure grouping intent is visible in history.
- Rule: if a change is justified as “expected/intentional formatting only,” capture that justification in notes to avoid future confusion.

## Debug Notes (Only if applicable)
- **Failing test / error:** None in this session.
- **Repro steps:** N/A.
- **Breakpoints / logs used:** `git status --short`, `git --no-pager log --oneline -n 6`.
- **Final diagnosis:** This was source-control hygiene work, not runtime debugging.

## Follow-ups / TODO (For Future Agents)
- [ ] Add a lightweight helper script to print grouped staging candidates by top-level path (`src/jit`, `src/interpreter`, `tests`, `examples`, etc.).
- [ ] Consider a policy check that blocks a single commit from spanning too many unrelated subsystems unless explicitly intentional.
