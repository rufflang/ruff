# Enhanced Collection Methods Implementation - Session Notes

**Date**: 2026-01-25  
**Session**: Enhanced Collection Methods (P2 Feature)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Version**: v0.8.0

---

## Summary

Implemented 20 new collection methods for arrays, dictionaries, and strings to complete the v0.8.0 Enhanced Collection Methods feature. All methods are fully tested and documented.

---

## What Was Implemented

### Array Methods (7 new)
- `chunk(arr, size)` - Split array into chunks
- `flatten(arr)` - Flatten nested arrays one level
- `zip(arr1, arr2)` - Zip two arrays into pairs
- `enumerate(arr)` - Add index to each element
- `take(arr, n)` - Take first n elements
- `skip(arr, n)` - Skip first n elements  
- `windows(arr, size)` - Create sliding windows

### Dictionary Methods (3 new)
- `invert(dict)` - Swap keys and values
- `update(dict1, dict2)` - Merge dictionaries (returns new)
- `get_default(dict, key, default)` - Get with default fallback

### String Methods (10 new)
- `pad_left(str, width, char)` - Pad left
- `pad_right(str, width, char)` - Pad right
- `lines(str)` - Split into lines
- `words(str)` - Split into words
- `str_reverse(str)` - Reverse string
- `slugify(str)` - URL-friendly slug
- `truncate(str, len, suffix)` - Truncate with suffix
- `to_camel_case(str)` - Convert to camelCase
- `to_snake_case(str)` - Convert to snake_case
- `to_kebab_case(str)` - Convert to kebab-case

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The implementation follows the established Ruff pattern:

1. **builtins.rs**: Core logic implementation
2. **interpreter.rs**: Function registration and call handlers
3. **type_checker.rs**: Type signatures for all functions

All functions are global functions (not methods), consistent with Ruff's functional style.

### Files Modified

- `src/builtins.rs` - Added implementation functions
- `src/interpreter.rs` - Registered functions and added call handlers
- `src/type_checker.rs` - Added type signatures
- `tests/test_enhanced_collections.ruff` - Comprehensive test suite
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented all new features
- `ROADMAP.md` - Marked feature as complete
- `README.md` - Added to feature list

## Key Gotchas & Learnings

### 1. "default" is a Reserved Keyword

**Problem**: Initially named the dict function `default()`, which conflicted with the `default` keyword used in match statements.

**Solution**: Renamed to `get_default()` to avoid keyword conflict.

**Why**: The lexer treats "default" as a keyword, so it can't be used as a function name.

**Lesson**: Always check if proposed function names conflict with reserved keywords in the lexer.

### 2. Function Naming Convention

**Pattern**: Ruff uses prefix notation for polymorphic operations:
- `str_reverse()` instead of `reverse()` (to avoid conflict with array reverse)
- Regular functions can have the same name if they operate on different types (polymorphic)

**Example**: `reverse()` works for arrays, so string reverse is `str_reverse()`

### 3. Case Conversion Edge Cases

**Implementation Notes**:
- `to_snake_case()` handles consecutive uppercase letters (e.g., "HTTPServer" → "http_server")
- `to_camel_case()` splits on non-alphanumeric characters
- `slugify()` handles multiple spaces and special characters properly

**Testing**: All edge cases covered in test suite.

---

## Testing

Created `tests/test_enhanced_collections.ruff` with comprehensive test coverage:

- **Array methods**: 30+ test cases covering normal use, edge cases, empty arrays
- **String methods**: 25+ test cases covering various inputs, Unicode, edge cases
- **Dict methods**: 10+ test cases including inversion, updates, defaults
- **Chaining examples**: Demonstrated method composition

All tests pass successfully.

## Commits

1. `:package: NEW: implement enhanced collection methods (arrays, dicts, strings)` - Core implementation
2. `:book: DOC: document enhanced collection methods in CHANGELOG` - Documentation
3. `:book: DOC: mark Enhanced Collection Methods as complete in ROADMAP` - Roadmap update
4. `:book: DOC: add enhanced collection methods to README feature list` - README update

---

## Performance Considerations

All methods use efficient Rust implementations:
- `chunk()` uses slice `chunks()` iterator
- `flatten()` uses `extend()` for efficient vector extension
- `zip()` uses iterator `zip()` for lazy evaluation
- String case conversions iterate once through characters
- No unnecessary allocations or copies

---

## What Was NOT Implemented

The following methods from the ROADMAP were deferred as they require higher-order function enhancements:

- `filter_map(func)` - Needs enhanced closure support
- `partition(func)` - Needs enhanced closure support
- `dict.filter(func)` - Needs higher-order dict operations
- `dict.map_values(func)` - Needs higher-order dict operations
- `dict.map_keys(func)` - Needs higher-order dict operations

These will be implemented in a future release when the functional programming infrastructure is enhanced.

## Next Steps

The Enhanced Collection Methods feature is now complete for v0.8.0. According to the ROADMAP, the next high-priority features are:

1. **Bytecode Compiler & VM** (P1) - Very large effort (6-8 weeks)
2. **Standard Library Expansion** (P1) - Large effort (3 months)
3. **Async/Await** (P1) - Very large effort (6-8 weeks)
4. **Iterators & Generators** (P1) - Large effort (3-4 weeks)

All of these are multi-week projects. For immediate next steps, consider:
- **Built-in Testing Framework** (P1, 2-3 weeks)
- **Code Formatter** (P1, 2-3 weeks)
- **Linter** (P1, 3-4 weeks)

## Mental Model

Enhanced Collections in Ruff:
- All collection methods are **global functions** taking collection as first parameter
- Follows functional programming patterns (no mutation of originals)
- Methods are **chainable** for data transformation pipelines
- Type signatures allow basic type checking without full generic system
- Implementation favors **clarity and correctness** over premature optimization
