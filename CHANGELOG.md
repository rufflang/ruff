# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the Ruff programming language will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Field Assignment**: Full support for mutating struct fields with `:=` operator
  - Direct field mutation: `person.age := 26`
  - Nested field mutation: `todos[0].done := true`
  - Works with array indexing and dictionary keys
- **Truthy/Falsy Evaluation**: If conditions now properly handle boolean values and collections
  - Boolean identifiers (`true`/`false`) work in conditionals
  - Strings: "true" → truthy, "false" → falsy, empty → falsy
  - Arrays: empty → falsy, non-empty → truthy
  - Dictionaries: empty → falsy, non-empty → truthy
- **Test Suite**: Added 10 comprehensive integration tests covering:
  - Field assignment for structs and arrays
  - Boolean conditions and truthy values
  - Array and dict operations
  - String concatenation
  - For-in loops
  - Variable assignment behavior
  - Struct field access
- **Example Projects**: Two demonstration projects showcasing language features
  - Todo Manager: struct mutation, arrays, control flow
  - Contact Manager: dictionaries, string functions, error handling
- **Clean Build**: Zero compiler warnings - all infrastructure code properly annotated

### Fixed
- **Variable Assignment**: `:=` operator now consistently creates or updates variables
  - Previously would fail if variable didn't exist in certain contexts
  - Now always inserts/updates in environment
- **Boolean Handling**: Fixed if statements not recognizing boolean struct fields
  - Was only checking numeric values for truthiness
  - Now properly evaluates boolean identifiers and other types
- **Pattern Matching**: Corrected struct pattern matching syntax in field assignment
  - Changed from incorrect `Value::Struct(ref mut fields)` 
  - To correct `Value::Struct { name: _, fields }`

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Clarified that example projects are demonstrations, not interactive applications
- **Build Output**: Added `--quiet` flag recommendation for clean execution output
- **README**: Updated with clearer feature descriptions and usage examples

### Known Limitations (Documented)
- No lexical scoping - uses single global environment
- Variable shadowing in blocks doesn't update outer scope (design limitation)
- Booleans stored as string identifiers internally (architectural choice)
- No user input function yet (`input()` planned for future release)

### Technical Details
- Total tests: 14 (up from 4)
- Compiler warnings: 0 (down from 14)
- Lines of test code added: ~200
- Files modified: interpreter.rs, ast.rs, errors.rs, builtins.rs, module.rs

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- Initial release of Ruff programming language
- Core language features:
  - Variables and constants
  - Functions with optional type annotations
  - Control flow (if/else, loops, pattern matching)
  - Data types (numbers, strings, enums, arrays, dicts, structs)
  - Struct definitions with methods
  - Type system with inference and checking
  - Module system with imports/exports
  - Error handling (try/except/throw)
- Built-in functions:
  - Math: abs, sqrt, pow, floor, ceil, round, min, max, trig functions
  - Strings: len, to_upper, to_lower, trim, substring, contains, replace
  - Arrays: push, pop, slice, concat
  - Dicts: keys, values, has_key, remove
- Command-line interface with run and test commands
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
