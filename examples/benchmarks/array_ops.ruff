# Array Operations Benchmark - map, filter, reduce operations
# Tests: Higher-order functions, closure creation, array iteration

# Create test array
let nums := []
let i := 0
while i < 100 {
    nums := push(nums, i)
    i := i + 1
}

# Map: square all numbers
let squared := map(nums, |x| x * x)

# Filter: keep even numbers
let evens := filter(squared, |x| x % 2 == 0)

# Reduce: sum all values
let sum := reduce(evens, 0, |acc, x| acc + x)

# Result
let result := sum
