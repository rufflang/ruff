// Built-in workflow pack registrations.
//
// Built-in packs are compiled into the Ruff binary and have the highest
// priority during namespace resolution. They cannot be overridden by
// external packs.
//
// To add a built-in pack:
//   1. Create a new module under builtins/ (e.g., myteam.rs)
//   2. Add `pub mod myteam;` below
//   3. Implement command handlers as fn(&CommandContext) -> DoctorReport
//   4. Register the pack in register_all() below
//
// Currently no built-in packs are registered. The workflow pack system
// is designed so that teams can create external packs without modifying
// Ruff core. See docs/WORKFLOW_PACKS.md for details.
