# Ruff Pre-1.0 Master Unfinished Checklist

Status: active pre-`v1.0.0` completion roadmap (team-lead audit pass)  
Audit date: 2026-05-20

Purpose: consolidate every still-unfinished or still-unclear pre-1.0 item into one execution checklist, including:
- explicit open checklist/roadmap/release items
- runtime-path limitations (especially interpreter-flag dependencies)
- stale or conflicting documentation
- research-first tasks needed to make confident implementation decisions

Primary evidence sources:
- `docs/PRE_V1_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md`
- `docs/UNFINISHED_AND_MVP_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/VM_INTERPRETER_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `notes/2026-05-20_09-07_prev1-rel-001-rc-gate-evidence.md`
- `src/main.rs`, `src/parser.rs`, `tests/` interpreter-mode usage surfaces

## Checklist Governance And Closure Semantics

This checklist is executed in strict one-item loops.

### Loop Selection Rule (Mandatory)

1. Only pick items still marked `- [ ]`.
2. Choose the first unchecked item in top-to-bottom file order.
3. Do not skip ahead unless the current item is explicitly blocked.
4. If blocked:
   - Add a dated blocker note directly under the blocked item with reason + command/output evidence.
   - Continue scanning to the next unchecked item in the same loop.
5. Complete exactly one unblocked checklist item per loop.

### Closure Evidence Rule (Mandatory)

Do not mark an item complete until all of the following exist for that item:

1. Implementation or decision artifact committed (code/script/doc/note as applicable).
2. Tests or command validations run and recorded in loop evidence.
3. Relevant docs/checklists updated and consistent with the new state.
4. Checklist row switched from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` with a dated evidence bullet.
5. Commit message references the checklist ID (for example: `prev1(V1U-RES-003): ...`).

### Blocker Semantics

- A blocked item remains unchecked.
- Blocker notes must include:
  - Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - Root-cause summary
  - Verifiable evidence (command path, file path, or link)
- Re-check blocked items in later loops before skipping again.

### Required Per-Loop Report Fields

Each loop report must include exactly:

1. Item completed.
2. Files changed.
3. Tests/commands run with results.
4. Blockers or follow-ups.

## 0) Research And Truth-Set (Do First)

- [x] **V1U-RES-001**: Build a machine-generated unresolved-item inventory.
  - Scope: produce one auditable table from docs/notes/code that lists unresolved items, source file, last touched date, and current owner.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Scripted inventory output committed under `docs/generated/` or equivalent.
    - Every item in this checklist maps to at least one source reference.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `scripts/generate_pre_v1_unresolved_inventory.sh` and generated `docs/generated/PRE_V1_UNRESOLVED_INVENTORY.md` + `.csv`.

- [x] **V1U-RES-002**: Classify unresolved items into `v1-blocker`, `v1-should-fix`, `post-v1`, or `archive`.
  - Scope: prevent stale tasks and historical noise from being treated as active blockers.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Classification rationale documented per item.
    - `docs/UNFINISHED_AND_MVP_AUDIT.md` updated to match classifications.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Extended `scripts/generate_pre_v1_unresolved_inventory.sh` to emit per-item `classification` + `rationale` columns and regenerated markdown/CSV outputs.
    - Replaced `docs/UNFINISHED_AND_MVP_AUDIT.md` with a classification-aligned snapshot that mirrors generated category counts and semantics.

- [x] **V1U-RES-003**: Define checklist governance and closure semantics.
  - Scope: standardize what evidence is required before checking an item complete (test output, note link, command logs).
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Closure policy section added to this file or a linked process doc.
    - Team can execute one-item-per-loop without ambiguity.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `Checklist Governance And Closure Semantics` section with strict selection, blocker, closure-evidence, and reporting rules.
    - Added `tests/pre_v1_master_checklist_contract.rs` to enforce required governance markers.

  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `docs/PRE_V1_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` no longer has unresolved blocker state for this item.
    - External edit/handoff evidence captured in `notes/`.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Updated `docs/PRE_V1_ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` so `PREV1-RUN-002` is no longer unresolved/blocked in this repository.
    - Added formal handoff note `notes/2026-05-20_12-55_v1u-open-001_ruff-mcp-doc-handoff.md` with validation evidence, target scope, and follow-through instructions for the external `ruff-mcp` source repo.

  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `cargo fmt --check` passes locally.
    - Follow-up evidence note updates `PREV1-REL-001` context.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Applied formatting with `cargo fmt` and verified `cargo fmt --check` passes locally.
    - Updated `notes/2026-05-20_09-07_prev1-rel-001-rc-gate-evidence.md` follow-up section to record drift resolution and status transition.

- [x] **V1U-GATE-002**: Decide rustfmt config policy (stable vs nightly-only options warnings).
  - Scope: eliminate persistent `rustfmt` unstable-option warnings or document intentional policy.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - either warnings removed, or policy doc explains expected warning behavior and gate implications.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Adopted stable-only `rustfmt.toml` policy by removing unstable option keys that emitted warning spam on stable toolchains.
    - Verified warning-free formatting gate execution with `cargo fmt` and `cargo fmt --check`.

- [x] **V1U-GATE-003**: Re-run full RC gate in low-contention environment and record pass/fail evidence.
  - Scope: repeat `bash scripts/release_candidate_gate.sh --full` after formatting and stability fixes.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - dated `notes/` evidence with command log and explicit instability classification.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):

    - Classified result as environment/runtime instability in docgen external-host validation stack (after fmt/clippy gates passed), with follow-through pointed to `V1U-GATE-004`.

- [x] **V1U-GATE-004**: Stabilize socket/timing-sensitive release suites if flake persists.
  - Scope: harden `serve` integration startup reliability and timing-fragile test expectations as needed.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - repeatable pass in low-contention environment across at least two consecutive full runs.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Hardened environment-sensitive DocGen release-test surfaces in `src/docgen/gaps.rs` and `tests/docgen_universal.rs` to avoid host-runtime panic cascades.
    - Captured targeted regression reruns and two consecutive `bash scripts/release_candidate_gate.sh --full` PASS results in `notes/2026-05-20_15-05_v1u-gate-004-stabilization.md`.

## 3) Interpreter-Flag Dependency Burn-Down (Team-Lead Priority)

- [x] **V1U-RUN-001**: Produce a full interpreter-flag dependency map.
  - Scope: inventory every `--interpreter` use in CLI paths, harnesses, tests, docs, and examples.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - dependency map includes reason tags (`parity-gap`, `diagnostics-diff`, `harness-legacy`, `security-test-choice`, etc.).
    - map published in `docs/` and linked from this checklist.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added generator `scripts/generate_interpreter_flag_dependency_map.sh` and published `docs/INTERPRETER_FLAG_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md`.
    - Map inventories `--interpreter` usage across CLI harness source, integration tests, docs/examples, and historical notes with explicit reason tags.

- [x] **V1U-RUN-002**: Explain and justify `ruff test` interpreter hardcoding in `src/parser.rs::run_all_tests`.
  - Scope: confirm whether this is still required, and if yes, define removal criteria.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - documented root-cause analysis with concrete failing fixtures/surfaces if VM-first is not yet safe.
    - decision recorded: keep temporarily, switch to VM-first, or dual-mode with fixture metadata.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added dated root-cause analysis note `notes/2026-05-20_16-10_v1u-run-002_ruff-test-interpreter-hardcoding-analysis.md` with a concrete mismatch scan (`SCANNED=21 MISMATCHES=15`) and named divergent fixtures/surface classes.
    - Extended generated dependency map output (`scripts/generate_interpreter_flag_dependency_map.sh` -> `docs/INTERPRETER_FLAG_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md`) with an explicit `V1U-RUN-002` decision section and removal criteria for `V1U-RUN-003`.
    - Added/updated contract coverage in `tests/interpreter_flag_dependency_map_contract.rs` to lock the decision markers and `run_all_tests` interpreter pin.

- [x] **V1U-RUN-003**: Implement a VM-first or dual-engine `ruff test` execution strategy.
  - Scope: reduce reliance on blanket interpreter execution for fixture sweeps.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `ruff test` can run VM for parity-safe fixtures.
    - fallback policy is explicit, bounded, and tested.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `ruff test --runtime dual|vm|interpreter` (default `dual`) and wired `src/parser.rs::run_all_tests` to execute VM-primary with bounded interpreter fallback in dual mode.
    - Added runtime-strategy contract coverage in `tests/cli_contracts.rs` for VM-only mismatch failures and dual-mode fallback success on a deterministic drift fixture.
    - Recorded implementation rationale, fallback boundaries, and validation results in `notes/2026-05-20_16-55_v1u-run-003-ruff-test-runtime-strategy.md`.

- [x] **V1U-RUN-004**: Close generator-surface ambiguity between docs/tests/runtime.
  - Scope: remove the “VM generator support is partial” drift signal by either fixing VM support gaps or making boundary explicit in canonical docs.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - generator behavior status is consistent across `README`, parity matrix, and generator tests.
    - no silent engine-specific behavior differences in covered generator scenarios.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added explicit generator divergence coverage in `tests/vm_interpreter_parity_surfaces.rs` (`generator_iteration_surface_is_intentionally_divergent_with_explicit_vm_error`) so interpreter success and VM deterministic error behavior are both contract-locked.
    - Updated `README.md` known-boundary wording to explicitly state current top-level generator divergence (interpreter-supported, VM deterministic error) while preserving struct-generator unsupported policy clarity.
    - Updated `docs/VM_INTERPRETER_PARITY_MATRIX.md` with a dedicated top-level generator iteration row marked `intentionally divergent`; implementation/validation summary recorded in `notes/2026-05-20_17-20_v1u-run-004-generator-parity-clarification.md`.

- [x] **V1U-RUN-005**: Expand parity evidence for any surface still commonly forced to interpreter mode.
  - Scope: for each dependency-map item tagged `parity-gap`, add targeted VM/interpreter parity tests or explicit documented divergence.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - either parity tests exist, or divergence is intentional and documented in release-facing docs.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Extended `scripts/generate_interpreter_flag_dependency_map.sh` and regenerated `docs/INTERPRETER_FLAG_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md` to emit explicit `parity-gap` tagging and a dedicated `V1U-RUN-005` coverage status section.
    - Tagged `src/parser.rs` as `harness-legacy,parity-gap` and mapped closure evidence to `tests/cli_contracts.rs` (runtime fallback contracts), `tests/vm_interpreter_parity_surfaces.rs` (generator divergence contract), plus canonical docs (`README.md`, `docs/VM_INTERPRETER_PARITY_MATRIX.md`).
    - Added contract checks in `tests/interpreter_flag_dependency_map_contract.rs` and recorded the audit in `notes/2026-05-20_17-45_v1u-run-005-parity-gap-coverage.md`.

- [x] **V1U-RUN-006**: Add command-level runtime-path matrix.
  - Scope: complement `docs/VM_INTERPRETER_PARITY_MATRIX.md` with command-level coverage (`run`, `test`, `test-run`, security suites, diagnostics modes).
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - maintainers can see exactly which runtime path each command/test surface depends on and why.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `Command-Level Runtime Path Matrix` section to `docs/VM_INTERPRETER_PARITY_MATRIX.md` covering `run`, `test` runtime strategy modes, `test-run`, security suites, and diagnostics/parse-only command surfaces.
    - Added `tests/runtime_path_matrix_contract.rs` to enforce required command/runtime-path markers and key rows.
    - Recorded implementation summary and validation evidence in `notes/2026-05-20_18-05_v1u-run-006-command-runtime-path-matrix.md`.

## 4) Documentation Integrity And Staleness Cleanup

- [x] **V1U-DOC-001**: Replace or fully refresh stale `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - Scope: resolve major drift (v0.8/v0.9 language, VM-default mismatch, outdated component status).
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - architecture doc reflects current execution defaults and release posture.
    - no contradictory “VM experimental/not default” claims against current README/CLI behavior.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Replaced `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with a current architecture baseline aligned to VM-default execution, explicit interpreter fallback usage, and pre-v1 release posture.
    - Added `tests/architecture_docs_contract.rs` to enforce required up-to-date runtime-path markers and reject stale v0.8/v0.9 wording.
    - Recorded implementation summary and validation evidence in `notes/2026-05-20_18-30_v1u-doc-001-architecture-refresh.md`.

- [x] **V1U-DOC-002**: Align maturity/boundary wording across top-level docs.
  - Scope: sync `README.md`, `docs/V1_SCOPE.md`, `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`, `docs/RUFF_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`, and `docs/UNFINISHED_AND_MVP_AUDIT.md`.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - one consistent story for pre-1.0 readiness, experimental surfaces, and deferred guarantees.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added a shared canonical readiness-boundary statement across `README.md`, `docs/V1_SCOPE.md`, `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`, `docs/RUFF_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`, and `docs/UNFINISHED_AND_MVP_AUDIT.md`.
    - Added docs consistency contract `tests/v1_maturity_boundary_alignment_contract.rs` to enforce this wording across all five source-of-truth docs.
    - This aligns pre-1.0 readiness messaging without changing release gating authority (`ROADMAP.md` + master unfinished checklist remain canonical blockers).

- [x] **V1U-DOC-003**: Review `docs/STANDARD_LIBRARY_REFERENCE.md` experimental labels for v1 contract clarity.
  - Scope: decide which experimental APIs are in v1 guarantee vs explicitly non-guaranteed.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - experimental-label policy documented and consistent with `docs/V1_SCOPE.md` and release commitments.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added explicit tier policy mapping (`stable`, `preview`, `experimental`) in `docs/STANDARD_LIBRARY_REFERENCE.md` that defines v1 guarantee vs non-guaranteed status.
    - Added canonical readiness/deferred-boundary references tying this policy to `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PRE_V1_MASTER_UNFINISHED_CHECKLIST.md`, and `docs/V1_SCOPE.md`.
    - Added `tests/stdlib_reference_policy_contract.rs` and captured implementation details in `notes/2026-05-20_19-15_v1u-doc-003-stdlib-tier-policy.md`.

- [x] **V1U-DOC-004**: Add/refresh docs contract tests for high-risk consistency surfaces.
  - Scope: prevent future drift in readiness, runtime-path expectations, and deferred-boundary claims.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - contract tests fail when key policy text disappears or contradicts other canonical docs.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `tests/docs_policy_consistency_contract.rs` to enforce cross-doc consistency for readiness boundary wording, generator divergence policy, stdlib tier guarantees, and architecture runtime posture.
    - The new contract complements existing focused docs contracts by explicitly checking policy agreement across `README.md`, scope/spec/audit docs, parity matrix, standard-library reference, and architecture docs.
    - Captured this contract refresh in `notes/2026-05-20_19-40_v1u-doc-004-docs-policy-contracts.md`.

## 5) Universal DocGen Next-Stage Milestones (From Open Roadmap/Doc Items)

- [x] **V1U-DG-001**: Execute `DG-NEXT-001` parser-assisted Ruff extraction fallback prototype.
  - Scope: opt-in parser-assisted extraction with deterministic regex fallback on diagnostics.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - parser-success and parser-fallback fixture coverage added.
    - strict-gate behavior remains deterministic.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added opt-in CLI/runtime support for parser-assisted Ruff extraction (`ruff docgen --ruff-parser-assisted`) by wiring `DocgenExtractionOptions` through `src/main.rs` and `src/docgen/core.rs`.
    - Implemented parser-assisted Ruff symbol extraction with deterministic regex fallback on lexer/parser diagnostics in `src/docgen/adapters/ruff.rs`.
    - Added fixture-backed success/fallback coverage (`tests/fixtures/docgen/ruff_parser_assisted_success.*`, `tests/fixtures/docgen/ruff_parser_assisted_fallback.*`) and matching integration tests in `tests/docgen_universal.rs`.

- [x] **V1U-DG-002**: Execute `DG-NEXT-002` cross-language adapter conformance expansion.
  - Scope: broaden multi-language edge-pattern fixture coverage and output-shape contracts.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - adapter conformance tests expanded across supported languages.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added cross-language edge fixtures (`tests/fixtures/docgen/conformance_edges.*`) spanning nested containers, async declarations, visibility edge cases, and documented/undocumented symbol mixes across Ruff/PHP/Python/TypeScript/JavaScript/Ruby/Go/Haskell/Zig.
    - Expanded `tests/docgen_universal.rs` with fixture-backed conformance coverage for output-shape stability and visibility/doc-attachment contracts (`docgen_adapter_conformance_edge_fixtures_preserve_shape_and_visibility_contracts`) plus strict public-only failure-path coverage (`docgen_adapter_conformance_edge_fixtures_strict_public_gate_reports_undocumented_symbols`).
    - Documented intentional per-language extraction gaps under `docs/DOCGEN.md` (`Intentional Adapter Extraction Gaps (Current)`) so conformance expansion and known boundaries stay aligned.

- [x] **V1U-DG-003**: Execute `DG-NEXT-003` external-repo strict-gate baseline refresh cadence.
  - Scope: codify cadence and evidence format for strict/public-only drift checks on representative external repos.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - repeatable cadence documented and at least one refreshed baseline note captured.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `External-Repo Strict Baseline Refresh Cadence` to `docs/DOCGEN.md`, including refresh frequency, required strict mode variants (`--include-private` and `--public-only`), evidence format, and a mitigation playbook for regressions.
    - Captured refreshed external baseline evidence in `notes/2026-05-20_17-59_v1u-dg-003-external-baseline-refresh-cadence.md` with command paths and per-repo strict/public-only counts.
    - Re-ran strict baselines for `/Users/robertdevore/2026/ruff-ai-sdk`, `/Users/robertdevore/2026/ruff-mcp`, and `/Users/robertdevore/2026/ruff-scout` (all counts remained `undocumented=0`, `broken_links=0`, `warnings=0`, `gate_failures=0`).

## 6) Code-Level “Half-Fixed” Risk Audit (Pre-1.0 Triage)

- [x] **V1U-CODE-001**: Audit `TODO/FIXME/HACK` debt in production paths and classify risk.
  - Scope: prioritize runtime/compiler/VM/interpreter/native-function TODOs that could affect v1 correctness/security predictability.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - triage table with severity, owner, and target release bucket (`v1` vs `post-v1`).
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added `scripts/generate_v1_code_todo_triage.sh` to produce machine-generated TODO/FIXME/HACK triage artifacts with severity, owner, release bucket, scope, and rationale columns.
    - Generated `docs/generated/V1_CODE_TODO_TRIAGE.md` and `docs/generated/V1_CODE_TODO_TRIAGE.csv` via strict-mode scan (`49` markers, `0` unclassified) across production and adjacent runtime/compiler/VM/interpreter/native-function paths.
    - Added `tests/v1_code_todo_triage_contract.rs` covering success-path artifact generation, strict-mode failure for unclassified paths, and deterministic output regression checks.

- [x] **V1U-CODE-002**: Resolve or explicitly defer high-risk TODOs in runtime execution paths.
  - Scope: focus on TODOs in VM/compiler/interpreter async ops and any code path user scripts hit by default.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - no unclassified high-risk TODO remains in default runtime path.
    - deferred items are documented in release-facing scope docs.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Replaced high-risk runtime-path TODO markers in `src/vm.rs`, `src/compiler.rs`, and `src/interpreter/native_functions/async_ops.rs` with explicit post-v1 deferral notes that reference release-facing scope documentation.
    - Added `Deferred Runtime Execution Backlog (Explicit v1 Deferrals)` to `docs/V1_SCOPE.md` documenting deferred runtime items and guardrails for future closure.
    - Regenerated strict triage artifacts with `bash scripts/generate_v1_code_todo_triage.sh --strict` (`docs/generated/V1_CODE_TODO_TRIAGE.md` + `.csv`); output now reports `0` high-severity TODO markers and `0` unclassified markers.
    - Captured loop rationale and regression note in `notes/2026-05-20_18-09_v1u-code-002-runtime-todo-deferrals.md`.

- [x] **V1U-CODE-003**: Verify optional typing non-enforcement boundaries remain intentional and well-isolated.
  - Scope: ensure current type-checker TODOs do not leak as misleading “supported” guarantees.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - v1 optional-typing docs match implementation boundaries and warning behavior.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Added runtime-path boundary contract coverage in `tests/optional_typing_v1_contract.rs` (`v1_optional_typing_warnings_are_interpreter_only`) proving interpreter mode emits non-fatal type-check warnings while VM/default mode remains dynamic without a type-check gate.
    - Updated `docs/OPTIONAL_TYPING_DESIGN.md` and `docs/V1_SCOPE.md` to explicitly document the interpreter-warning vs VM-no-gate boundary.
    - Revalidated optional-typing contract behavior with focused tests (`cargo test --test optional_typing_v1_contract`, `cargo test --test v1_scope_docs_alignment`).

## 7) Final Pre-Tag Execution

- [x] **V1U-FINAL-001**: Run final full gate bundle and archive evidence.
  - Scope: required release gates + targeted parity/security/contracts + artifact validation script.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - dated evidence note with pass/fail per command and environment details.
  - Evidence (2026-05-20):
    - Executed final bundle commands and archived per-command logs under `/private/tmp/v1u_final_001_2026-05-20_18-20`.
    - Recorded pass/fail outcomes and environment details in `notes/2026-05-20_18-20_v1u-final-001-gate-bundle-evidence.md`.
    - Result summary: focused parity/security/contracts/artifact commands passed; `bash scripts/release_candidate_gate.sh --full` failed at `cargo fmt --check` with explicit follow-up recorded.

- [x] **V1U-FINAL-002**: Perform release dry run from a clean tree.
  - Scope: rehearse version bump, checklist closure, tag flow, and artifact workflow without publishing.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - dry-run note proves deterministic repeatability and no undocumented manual steps.
  - Evidence (2026-05-21):
    - Added `notes/2026-05-21_10-05_v1u-final-002-release-dry-run-clean-tree.md` capturing full dry-run command sequence and results from a clean clone (`git status --short` empty, roadmap precheck PASS, minimal gate PASS, release-state check PASS, local-only tag rehearsal PASS).
    - Recorded deterministic full RC gate failure mode (`cargo fmt --check` drift) as reproducible dry-run output, with no undocumented/manual publish steps required.

- [ ] **V1U-FINAL-003**: Complete tag-time artifact checklist.
  - Scope: execute final release publication and post-publish smoke verification.
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - all items in `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md` checked with linked evidence.
  - Blocker (2026-05-21): This remains blocked until the actual `v1.0.0` publish event and post-publish artifact/smoke evidence exist.
    Evidence: `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md` `Tag-Time Sign-Off` rows are still unchecked and require real release URLs + checksum/sign-off workflow outcomes.
  - Blocker (2026-05-21): Revalidated in subsequent loop; no tag-time publication/sign-off evidence exists yet.
    Evidence: `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md` still requires actual release URLs, checksum files, and post-publish smoke workflow results.
  - Blocker (2026-05-21): Release-freeze revalidation for active loop; tag-time artifact completion is blocked until explicit `UNBLOCK_V1_RELEASE` instruction is provided.
    Evidence: Current session instructions block release publication/sign-off actions without `UNBLOCK_V1_RELEASE`, and `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md` `Tag-Time Sign-Off` items are still unchecked.
  - Blocker (2026-05-21): Release-freeze revalidation for loop 2; final tag-time artifact completion remains blocked without explicit `UNBLOCK_V1_RELEASE`.
    Evidence: `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md` still requires post-publish URLs/checksums/workflow evidence that cannot be produced under current freeze constraints.
  - Blocker (2026-05-21): Release-freeze revalidation for loop 3; no `UNBLOCK_V1_RELEASE` directive is present, so final tag-time artifact completion remains blocked.
    Evidence: Required post-publish artifact URLs/checksums/smoke evidence in `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md` cannot be produced while release actions are frozen.
