# Ruff LSP Reliability Track

Status: v0.14.0 reliability checklist baseline

## Lifecycle Churn Contract

Ruff LSP lifecycle notifications are expected to tolerate churn in this order:

- `textDocument/didOpen`
- repeated `textDocument/didChange`
- `textDocument/didClose`

Resilience expectations:

- `didChange` received before `didOpen` is ignored safely (no panic)
- malformed request payloads return JSON-RPC error envelopes (for example `-32602` invalid params)
- repeated open/change/close loops do not leak document state across iterations

Validation source:

- `tests/lsp_reliability_track.rs` (`malformed_sequences_and_lifecycle_churn_are_resilient`)

## Bounded-Memory Request Loop Contract

Repeated request loops (completion/hover/diagnostics-adjacent requests) must keep server document state bounded.

Validation source:

- `tests/lsp_reliability_track.rs` (`repeated_completion_and_diagnostics_requests_keep_document_state_bounded`)

The reliability contract uses `LspServer::open_document_count()` to assert document-state bounds under high iteration count loops.

## Startup And First-Response Latency Baselines

Reliability guardrails track startup and first-response latency using conservative averages over repeated runs:

- startup average guardrail: `< 20ms`
- first completion response average guardrail: `< 80ms`

Validation source:

- `tests/lsp_reliability_track.rs` (`startup_and_first_response_latency_stay_within_guardrails`)

These thresholds are intended to detect severe regressions while staying stable on shared CI hosts.
