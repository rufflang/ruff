# Ruff Release Process

Current active target: `1.0.0`

This document is the canonical release and compatibility policy for Ruff.
It defines how maintainers cut releases, what compatibility guarantees apply, and which gates must pass before a tag is created.

## 1. Versioning Policy

Ruff follows semantic versioning-oriented release classes:

- `MAJOR` (`X.y.z`): compatibility reset with explicit migration guidance.
- `MINOR` (`x.Y.z`): additive language/runtime/tooling features and planned compatibility updates.
- `PATCH` (`x.y.Z`): compatibility-preserving fixes, security fixes, performance improvements, and documentation/process corrections.

Pre-1.0 policy note:

- Ruff is currently pre-1.0 (`0.14.0`).
- Even before `1.0.0`, maintainers should avoid unnecessary breakage and document any intentional contract changes.

## 2. Compatibility Policy

### 2.1 Language compatibility

- Previously valid syntax should remain valid within a patch line.
- Parser/runtime behavior changes that alter existing successful program output require explicit changelog notes.
- Intentional breaking language changes require a planned release-cycle callout and migration notes.

### 2.2 Standard library compatibility

- Stable builtin names and documented argument contracts should remain compatible within a patch line.
- Security hardening may tighten behavior (for example rejecting unsafe defaults) when required; such changes must be documented as compatibility-impacting fixes.
- Capability requirements for host-effect APIs are part of the compatibility contract and must be documented in `docs/STANDARD_LIBRARY.md` and `docs/NATIVE_API_SECURITY_POSTURE.md`.

### 2.3 Diagnostics and machine-readable contract stability

- Human-readable diagnostic text may improve over time.
- Diagnostic `code`, `subsystem`, and machine-readable JSON field shape are stability surfaces.
- CLI/LSP JSON field removals or type changes are breaking; additive optional fields are non-breaking.

### 2.4 CLI exit-code stability

Exit code classes are contract-stable for automation:

- `0`: success
- `1`: command/gate failure
- `2`: usage/argument parse failure
- `3`: lexer/parser diagnostics
- `4`: runtime semantic failure
- `5`: IO failure
- `6`: internal/tooling failure

### 2.5 Dependency lockfile determinism

- Ruff package workflows treat `ruff.lock` as the deterministic dependency snapshot derived from `ruff.toml`.
- `ruff package-install` regenerates lockfile state deterministically (stable ordering and schema metadata).
- `ruff package-install --frozen` is the verify mode and must fail when `ruff.lock` is missing or out of date relative to `ruff.toml`.
- Release candidates should include a lockfile verification pass for package workflow fixtures and examples that use manifests.

## 3. Required CI And Local Gates

The release gate is enforced by `scripts/release_gate.sh` and CI workflows.

Canonical full gate command:

```bash
bash scripts/release_gate.sh --full
```

Release-candidate readiness gate command:

```bash
bash scripts/release_candidate_gate.sh --full
```

Fast smoke gate command:

```bash
bash scripts/release_gate.sh --minimal
```

Roadmap-only readiness precheck:

```bash
bash scripts/release_candidate_gate.sh --roadmap-only
```

Full gate command order:

1. `cargo fmt --check`
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
3. `cargo test`
4. Focused integration suites:
   - `cargo test --test native_api_security_boundaries`
   - `cargo test --test package_module_workflow_integration`
   - `cargo test --test vm_interpreter_parity_surfaces`
   - optional `cargo test --test serve_command_integration` when `RUFF_ENABLE_SOCKET_TESTS=1`
5. Ruff self-test fixtures: `cargo run -- test`
6. Optional tools when installed: `cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`

Optional benchmark smoke in full mode:

```bash
RUFF_RELEASE_GATE_RUN_BENCH=1 bash scripts/release_gate.sh --full
```

## 4. Release Candidate (RC) Process

Before tagging `1.0.0-rc` or `1.0.0`:

1. Confirm all P0 and P1 roadmap items are complete in `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Confirm every deferred P2 item is explicitly documented.
3. Run full release gate and required integration suites.
4. Validate release-state consistency checks.
5. Record release evidence in `notes/` with exact commands and outcomes.

Recommended RC staging flow:

1. Branch from `main` (for example `release/1.0.0-rc1`).
2. Freeze scope to release blockers only.
3. Re-run full gates after each blocker fix.
4. Cut RC tag only from a clean tree.
5. Promote RC to final tag only after all gates remain green.

## 5. Changelog Format Policy

`CHANGELOG.md` must follow Keep a Changelog structure with concrete user impact.

Required section categories (when applicable):

- `Added`
- `Changed`
- `Fixed`
- `Security`
- `Performance`
- `Removed`

Release-entry template:

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- ...

### Changed
- ...

### Fixed
- ...

### Security
- ...

### Performance
- ...
```

Rules:

- Keep entries specific and user-facing.
- Call out compatibility-impacting changes explicitly.
- Include migration guidance when behavior changes could break automation or scripts.

## 6. Pre-Release Checklist (Before Version Bump)

1. Confirm local repository state.

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
```

2. Run release gates.

```bash
bash scripts/release_gate.sh --full
bash .github/scripts/check-release-state.sh
```

3. Validate editor extension baseline when cycle scope includes editor/tooling updates.

```bash
cd tools/vscode-ruff-extension
npm ci
npm run check
cd ../..
```

4. Confirm roadmap and artifact checklist status:

- `ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST_V1_0_0.md`

5. Confirm release evidence notes exist and are up to date under `notes/`.

## 7. Version Bump And Documentation Sync

1. Set `[package].version` in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Create/complete the target release section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Update release-status strings in:
   - `README.md`
   - `ROADMAP.md`
4. Re-run release-state guard:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/check-release-state.sh
```

## 8. Tagging And Publication Order

1. Create release commit.

```bash
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock CHANGELOG.md README.md ROADMAP.md docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md
git commit -m ":rocket: RELEASE: vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
```

2. Create and push annotated tag.

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Ruff vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

3. Publish crate (when applicable):

```bash
cargo publish --dry-run
cargo publish
```

4. Publish GitHub release artifacts (Linux/macOS binaries + checksums) via release workflows.

5. Run published-artifact smoke validation and record outcomes.

## 9. Dry-Run Workflow (No Tag / No Publish)

Use before high-risk releases:

1. Create dry-run branch.
2. Execute full gates.
3. Apply version/doc edits as rehearsal.
4. Run checks again.
5. Create dry-run commit.
6. Record commands/results in `notes/`.
7. Discard or merge dry-run branch after review.

Dry-run success criteria:

- no undocumented manual steps
- deterministic command outcomes
- release-state guard passes

## 10. Required Release Evidence

Every release (including RC) needs a dated note under `notes/` that includes:

- execution context (local/CI, host details)
- exact commands run
- pass/fail status per command
- warnings/exceptions and rationale
- explicit sign-off statement for release readiness

Do not mark release checklist items complete without evidence.
