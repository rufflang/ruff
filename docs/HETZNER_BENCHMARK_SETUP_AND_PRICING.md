# Hetzner Benchmark Setup and Pricing for Ruff SSG

## Purpose
This document captures the recommended Hetzner-based environment for reproducible Ruff SSG benchmarking and fair cross-SSG comparisons.

Use this when Ruff is close to launch and you want stable, publishable benchmark results.

## Key Decision
Use one dedicated Hetzner instance for all benchmark runs in a campaign.

This gives:
- Consistent CPU, RAM, storage, and region per run
- Lower run-to-run noise than local laptop testing
- Fairer apples-to-apples comparison between Ruff and other SSGs

## Recommended Server Tier
Primary recommendation:
- Plan: CCX33 (General Purpose, dedicated vCPU)
- Specs: 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, 240 GB SSD
- Price: 62.99 EUR per month max, 0.1009 EUR per hour

Lower-cost reliable option:
- Plan: CCX23
- Specs: 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB SSD
- Price: 31.99 EUR per month max, 0.0513 EUR per hour

Higher-headroom option:
- Plan: CCX43
- Specs: 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM, 360 GB SSD
- Price: 125.49 EUR per month max, 0.2011 EUR per hour

## Benchmark Campaign Protocol
1. Fix one region and one instance type for the entire campaign.
2. Use the same OS image and package versions.
3. Run 5 warm-up runs and discard them.
4. Run at least 20 measured runs per mode.
5. Keep cold and warm/no-op metrics separate.
6. Report median, p90, min, max, and standard deviation.
7. Record full environment metadata in every report.

## Fairness Rules for Cross-SSG Comparisons
- Same host and hardware profile for all tools
- Same dataset and template complexity
- Same output scope (index, sitemap, feed where possible)
- Same filesystem location type (local SSD)
- Same iteration count and reporting statistics

## Suggested Execution Timing
Run this full benchmark campaign when Ruff is near launch:
- Your implementation is stable enough that numbers represent release reality
- You only need a short rented window to produce reproducible benchmark artifacts
- You can publish one coherent benchmark report with method and data

## Practical Notes
- Dedicated cloud is highly consistent, but still run multiple iterations and report distribution metrics.
- If you need maximum isolation, evaluate Hetzner dedicated root servers for a second validation pass.
- Keep this pricing section updated before publishing any public benchmark post.
