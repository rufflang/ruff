# Optional Typing Policy (v1.0.0)

This document defines Ruff's explicit v1 optional-typing policy.

## v1 Policy Summary

Status: v1.0.0 baseline draft (active)

For v1.0.0, Ruff typing is intentionally split into two categories:

- Supported in v1:
    - type-annotation syntax for function parameters, function returns, and variable/const declarations
    - parser/AST preservation of annotations as metadata
    - incremental adoption in mixed typed/untyped codebases without breaking existing dynamic execution
- Deferred after v1:
    - runtime type enforcement
    - mandatory static type checking gates in `ruff run`
    - typed-JIT specialization guarantees as part of the stable v1 contract

Compatibility contract for v1:

- annotated code must remain runnable under current dynamic semantics
- type annotations must not change runtime behavior by default
- missing annotations keep current dynamic behavior
- current execution-path boundary is explicit:
    - `ruff run --interpreter` emits non-fatal type-checking warnings when mismatches are detected
    - default VM execution (`ruff run`) does not run a static type-check gate before execution

## Goals

- Define a concrete annotation syntax surface for functions, variables, and collections.
- Define explicit v1 support/defer boundaries for runtime checking and optimization.
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing untyped Ruff code.

## Design Status

- **Scope**: v1 policy and compatibility contract
- **Implementation commitment**:
    - annotation syntax and metadata behavior are supported for v1
    - enforcement and optimization tracks remain deferred

## Stage 1: Annotation Surface Proposal

### Supported Type Syntax (proposed)

```text
func calculate(x: int, y: float) -> float {
    return x * y
}

let name: string := "Alice"
let enabled: bool := true
let scores: Array<int> := [95, 87, 92]
let user_scores: Dict<string, int> := {"alice": 95}
```

Current parse-clean equivalent under today's dynamic runtime:

```ruff
func calculate(x, y) {
    return x * y
}

name := "Alice"
enabled := true
scores := [95, 87, 92]
user_scores := {"alice": 95}
```

### Type Forms (proposed)

- Primitive: `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `null`
- Collections: `Array<T>`, `Dict<K, V>`, `Set<T>`
- Function return type: `func f(...) -> T`

### Annotation Semantics (proposed)

- Annotations are optional and additive.
- Untyped code remains valid and unchanged.
- Mixed typed/untyped code is supported.
- Missing annotations imply current dynamic behavior.

### Parser and Type-Checker Impact

- Parser: add annotation nodes on variable declarations and function signatures.
- AST: preserve annotations as metadata without changing runtime semantics by default.
- Type checker: run as optional pass that can emit diagnostics without blocking execution unless explicitly configured.

## Runtime Type Enforcement (Deferred)

Potential opt-in forms remain design candidates and are not part of the v1 stable contract:

```text
@type_check
func calculate(x: int, y: float) -> float {
    return x * y
}
```

Future global opt-in could be provided via CLI and/or config, for example:

- `ruff run script.ruff --type-check`
- project-level `ruff.toml` setting (deferred decision)

### Deferred Behavior Targets

- Default mode: no runtime type enforcement (current v1 behavior).
- Future opt-in mode: enforce argument and return type contracts on annotated functions.
- Future errors should be deterministic and include function name, parameter/return position, expected type, and actual runtime type.

### Future Error Shape Target

Human-facing format (subject to final wording):

- `TypeError: calculate arg#2 expected float, got string`
- `TypeError: calculate return expected float, got int`

Compatibility note:

- Existing error model remains authoritative; this format is a target for a post-v1 implementation.

## Current Type-Checker Inference Boundaries (v1)

- Method-call inference is intentionally partial:
    - known core method surfaces on `string`, `array`, and `dict` return concrete inferred types in the checker.
    - unknown/custom method surfaces intentionally fall back to `Any` instead of claiming unsupported precision.
- Selective imports now resolve exported function signatures from Ruff module files when the module can be discovered on the configured search paths:
    - `ruff run --interpreter` forwards the entry script's search roots into the checker so imported callables do not show up as false `Undefined function` warnings.
    - When a module cannot be analyzed safely, the checker still falls back to permissive imported-callable placeholders instead of rejecting dynamic code.
    - Dotted module names resolve the same way runtime module loading does (`from src.foo import bar` and `from foo.bar import baz` both use the search-path-based module lookup).
- Await/generator/struct-field inference remains conservative in v1 and may return `Any` or unknown where full static shape information is not yet modeled.
- These boundaries are deliberate for additive, non-breaking typing behavior and are tracked in generated TODO triage artifacts under `docs/generated/V1_CODE_TODO_TRIAGE.*`.

## Typed-JIT Optimization Boundaries (Deferred)

### Future Candidates

- Specialized numeric fast paths for consistently typed arithmetic.
- Reduced boxing/unboxing in tight loops over typed arrays.
- Improved call-site specialization for stable typed signatures.

### Out of Scope for v1.0.0

- Mandatory typing across all code.
- Full Hindley-Milner inference.
- Breaking syntax or runtime behavior changes for untyped code.
- Guarantees of fixed speedup multiples.

## Migration and Compatibility

- Existing untyped scripts continue to run unchanged.
- Teams can adopt annotations incrementally per module/function.
- Typed and untyped modules interoperate through existing runtime value model.
- Any future runtime checks must remain opt-in and backward compatible by default.

## Open Decisions (Post-v1)

- Final syntax for union/optional types (e.g., `A | B` vs helper forms).
- How generic parameter constraints are represented (if at all).
- CLI-only vs config-based type-check mode enabling.
- Whether warnings-only mode should be separate from strict fail mode.

## Non-Goals for v1

- Shipping a full compiler-grade static type system.
- Requiring developers to annotate all public functions.
- Changing default dynamic semantics in v1.0.

## v1 Decision

Ruff v1 adopts **optional, incremental typing metadata** with strict backward compatibility:

- keep dynamic execution as default
- support annotation syntax and metadata preservation
- defer runtime checks to a future opt-in track
- defer typed-JIT specialization guarantees to a future release

This policy keeps v1 semantics stable while leaving room for future typed enforcement and optimization work without breaking existing code.
